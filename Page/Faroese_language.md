FAROESE[1] ( or ;[2] , ) is a North Germanic language spoken as a first language by about 72,000 people, around 49,000 of whom reside on the Faroe Islands and 23,000 in other areas, mainly Denmark. It is one of five languages descended from Old West Norse spoken in the Middle Ages, the others being Norwegian, Icelandic, and the extinct Norn and Greenlandic Norse. Faroese and Icelandic, its closest extant relative, are not mutually intelligible in speech, but the written languages resemble each other quite closely, largely owing to Faroese's etymological orthography.[3]


History

() is the oldest surviving document of the Faroe Islands. Written in 1298 in Old Norse, it contains some words and expressions believed to be especially Faroese.[4]]] ]] Around 900, the language spoken in the Faroes was Old Norse, which Norse settlers had brought with them during the time of the settlement of Faroe Islands () that began in 825. However, many of the settlers were not from Scandinavia, but descendants of Norse settlers in the Irish Sea region. In addition, women from Norse Ireland, Orkney, or Shetland often married native Scandinavian men before settling in the Faroe Islands and Iceland. As a result, the Irish language has had some influence on both Faroese and Icelandic. There is some debatable evidence of Irish language place names in the Faroes: for example, the names of Mykines, Stóra Dímun, Lítla Dímun and Argir have been hypothesized to contain Celtic roots. Other examples of early-introduced words of Celtic origin are: / (buttermilk), cf. Middle Irish ; (tail-piece of an animal), cf. Middle Irish ; (head, headhair), cf. Middle Irish ; (hand, paw), cf. Middle Irish ; (bull), cf. Middle Irish ; and (pasture in the outfield), cf. Middle Irish .[5]

Between the 9th and the 15th centuries, a distinct Faroese language evolved, although it was probably still mutually intelligible with Old West Norse, and remained similar to the Norn language of Orkney and Shetland during Norn's earlier phase.

Faroese ceased to be a written language after the union of Norway with Denmark in 1380, with Danish replacing Faroese as the language of administration and education.[6] The islanders continued to use the language in ballads, folktales, and everyday life. This maintained a rich spoken tradition, but for 300 years the language was not used in written form.

In 1823 the Danish Bible Society published a diglot of the Gospel of Matthew, with Faroese on the left and Danish on the right.

Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb and the Icelandic grammarian and politician Jón Sigurðsson published a written standard for Modern Faroese in 1854, which still exists.[7] They set a standard for the orthography of the language, based on its Old Norse roots and similar to that of Icelandic. The main purpose of this was for the spelling to represent the diverse dialects of Faroese in equal measure. Additionally, it had the advantages of being etymologically clear and keeping the kinship with the Icelandic written language. The actual pronunciation, however, often differs considerably from the written rendering. The letter _ð_, for example, has no specific phoneme attached to it.

Jakob Jakobsen devised a rival system of orthography, based on his wish for a phonetic spelling, but this system was never taken up by the speakers.[8]

In 1908 Scripture Gift Mission published the Gospel of John in Faroese.

In 1937, Faroese replaced Danish as the official school language, in 1938 as the church language, and in 1948 as the national language by the Home Rule Act of the Faroes. However, Faroese did not become the common language of media and advertising until the 1980s. Today Danish is considered a foreign language, although around 5% of residents on the Faroes learn it as a first language, and it is a required subject for students in third grade[9] and up.

The Visit Faroese tourism organisation launched the Faroe Islands Translate online service in 2017, available in English and another 13 languages including Chinese, Russian, Japanese, and Portuguese. A Faroese video database has also been built.[10]


Old Faroese

Old Faroese (_miðaldarføroyskt_, ca. mid-14th to mid-16th centuries) is a form of Old Norse spoken in medieval times in the Faroe Islands. The language shares many features with both Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian; Old Norwegian appears closer to Old Faroese, whereas Old Icelandic remained rather archaic compared to other medieval varieties of Old West Norse. The most crucial aspects of the development of Faroese are diphthongisation and palatalisation.

There is not enough data available to establish an accurate chronology of Faroese, but a rough one may be developed through comparison to the chronologies of Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian. In the 12th/13th centuries, _á_ and _ǫ́_ merged as ; later on at the beginning of the 14th century, delabialization took place: _y_, _øy_, _au_ > /i, ɔi, ɛi/; _í_ and _ý_ merged in addition to _i_ and _y_, but in the case of _í_ and _ý_, it appears that labialisation took place instead as is documented by later development to . Further, the language underwent a palatalisation of _k_, _g_ and _sk_ before Old Norse _e_, _i_, _y_, _ø_, _au_ > > > . Before the palatalisation _é_ and _ǽ_ merged as and approximately in the same period epenthetic _u_ is inserted into word-final and clusters. A massive quantity shift also operated in Middle Faroese. In the case of _skerping_, it took place after delabialization but before loss of post-vocalic _ð_ and _g_ . The shift of _hv_ to , the deletion of in (remaining) word-initial –sonorant clusters (_hr_, _hl_, _hn_ > _r_, _l_, _n_), and the dissolution of _þ_ (_þ_ > _t_; _þ_ > _h_ in demonstrative pronouns and adverbs)[11] appeared before the end of the 13th century. Another undated change is the merger of _ǫ_, _ø_ and _ǿ_ into ; pre-nasal _ǫ_, _ǫ́_ > _o_, _ó_. _enk_, _eng_ probably became _eing_, _eink_ in the 14th century; the development of _a_ to before _ng_, _nk_ appeared after the palatalisation of _k_, _g_, and _sk_ had been completed, such a change is quite a recent development, as well as change _Cve_ > _Cvø_.

: Faroese vowels

As with most other Germanic languages, Faroese has a large number of vowels, with 26 in total. Vowel distribution is similar to other North Germanic languages in that short vowels appear in closed syllables (those ending in consonant clusters or long consonants) and long vowels appearing in open syllables. provides the following alternations:

: caption|Faroese vowel alternations[13]

Faroese shares with Icelandic and Danish the feature of maintaining a contrast between stops based exclusively on aspiration, not voicing. Geminated stops may be pre-aspirated in intervocalic and word-final position. Intervocalically the aspirated consonants become pre-aspirated unless followed by a closed vowel. In clusters, the preaspiration merges with a preceding nasal or apical approximant, rendering them voiceless.

: Faroese consonants

There are several phonological processes involved in Faroese, including:

-   Nasals generally assume the place of articulation and laryngeal settings of following consonants.
-   Velar stops palatalize to postalveolar affricates before and
-   becomes before voiceless consonants

-   becomes after and before

-   becomes retroflex following consonants in consonant clusters, yielding the allophones while itself becomes , example: is realized as .

-   Pre-occlusion of original to and to .
-   Pre-aspiration of original voiceless stops after non-high long vowels and diphthongs or when a voiceless stop is followed by /n, l, r/. All long voiceless stops are pre-aspirated when doubled or in clusters .


Grammar

Faroese grammar is related and very similar to that of modern Icelandic and Old Norse. Faroese is an inflected language with three grammatical genders and four cases: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive.
