Notable residents

The Scottish physician, librarian, and medical historian Robert Willis lived and practised there from 1846 until his death in 1878.[4]

Sir Ralph Moor, high commissioner of the British Southern Nigeria Protectorate poisoned himself there in 1909. The coroner's jury determined that "the poison was deliberately taken whilst temporarily insane after suffering acutely from insomnia", having heard evidence that Moor had suffered for the last four years on his return from Africa with malarial and backwater fever that induced insomnia.[5]
