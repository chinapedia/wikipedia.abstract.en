It was his experience of tribal culture in Bissam Cuttack that prompted him to produce _Jiantaa Bhoota_ (The Living Ghost), the National Award-winning film that yet again put the limelight on Odia film Industry. Directed by Prashant Nanda, the film dealt with exploitation of environment, economy, culture in the name of industrialisation and resultant displacement, focusing on vanishing culture of Dongria Kondha tribals inhabiting the Niyamgiri Hills of Rayagada district due to mindless mining.
