AN EVENING OF YES MUSIC AND MORE was a worldwide concert tour by the rock band Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman, formed by lead vocalist Jon Anderson, guitarist Trevor Rabin and keyboardist Rick Wakeman, all former members of the English rock band Yes. Launched ten months after the group officially announced their formation, the tour visited theatres, halls, and arenas across North America, Europe and Asia.

The name of the tour is a reference to _An Evening of Yes Music Plus_, a 1989-90 concert tour by ABWH, an older band which also consisted of former Yes members, and of which Anderson and Wakeman were members.

The tour is documented on a live album and DVD.[1]


Overview

The tour began on 4 October 2016 under the name _Anderson, Rabin and Wakeman_[2] and ran until the end of summer 2017.[3] The band started using the new name of _Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin and Rick Wakeman_ on the early 2017 tour leg, and then launched the new name in April to promote the North American summer tour.

Additional touring musicians were bassist Lee Pomeroy and drummer Lou Molino III. The tour marked the first time the three former Yes members performed together since Yes' Union Tour of 1991–1992. The tour saw two songs dropped from the set after only one show: "Leaves of Green" and "Starship Trooper". Other songs were steadily added to the set as Rabin's confidence in his voice improved; the song "Lift Me Up" was added for the second show on 7 October 2016, and a fan favourite, "Changes", was added to the show on 22 October 2016.[4]

Setlists

Pre-tour speculation

In an interview with _Rolling Stone_ magazine, Anderson stated that the band would perform classic Yes songs like "Awaken" and "And You and I" as well as some songs from _Talk_ (1994), _90125_ (1983) and _Big Generator_ (1987). Anderson also hinted at the songs "Perpetual Change" and "Starship Trooper" to be played. He also assured that the setlist shouldn't fluctuate from night to night, stating: "It's like a movie to me, a play. Once you've got [the setlist] right, you stick to it since it'll only get better. If you start changing it you finish up a little bit confused."[8]

In a separate interview with _The Prog Report_ Rabin stated that "Shoot High, Aim Low" was due to be performed on the tour as well as "a lot from _90125_".[9]
