_KHANOM THIAN_ (, candle pudding or pastry) is a type of Thai _khanom_ (snack or dessert)[1] prepared in the shape of a candle.[2] It originated in northern Thailand, and is used by some people as a ceremonial dish.


Overview

_Khanom thian_ is a pudding or pastry prepared using rice flour or corn flour, coconut milk that has been sweetened, such as with brown sugar,[3] and sesame seeds.[4] Salt is also sometimes used as an ingredient.[5] The mixture is then steamed in banana leaves formed into an enclosed packet shaped like a cone.[6][7][8] After being cooked, its color is similar to that of molasses.[9] It is sometimes garnished with shredded coconut.[10]


History

The dish originated in the northernmost part of Thailand.[11] _Khanom thian_ has been described as a "ceremonial pudding", and the dish is used as an offering by Chinese Thais to their ancestors during New Year's Eve ceremonies.[12] After the ceremonial offering, _khanom thian_ is given to friends and relatives as a gift.[13]
