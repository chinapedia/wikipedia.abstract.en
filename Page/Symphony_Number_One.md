History

SNO_Stravinsky_septet_August_2017_02.jpg Symphony Number One was founded in 2015 by Jordan Randall Smith, Nicholas Bentz, and Sean Meyers, all of whom were graduate and undergraduate students at the Peabody Institute.[3][4] Symphony Number One is a chamber orchestra devoted to performing works by emerging composers. A non-profit performing arts organization, SNO maintains close relationships with the other independent classical music organizations of Baltimore, and is a part of Maryland's classical arts space.[5] With its focus on contemporary music, SNO can also be classified as a contemporary classical ensemble.

The orchestra's president is Dr. Janan Broadbent and Ben Goldberg is SNO's Composer-in-Residence. The orchestra's current concertmaster is Nikita Borisevich. Founder Jordan Randall Smith and co-founder Nicholas Bentz are current members of the collective. The other co-founder was Saxophonist Sean Meyers; Smith, Bentz, and Meyers first met at the Peabody Institute.[6] The three put together the inaugural concert in May 2015 at the Baltimore War Memorial.[7][8] In 2017, SNO appointed Brian Tracey as Executive Director.[9]

SNO was invited to perform at the inaugural Light City festival on April 2, 2016 in Baltimore.[10][11][12] In September 2016, Symphony Number One began its second season with compositions by Strauss, Mahler, and Steve Reich.[13] SNO was named a "Category Buster" by Baltimore Magazine in their 2016 "Best of Baltimore" issue;[14] SNO also won runner up for "Best Band" in Baltimore Magazine's Reader's Poll.[15] In addition, SNO was featured in _I Care if You Listen_'s Mixtape #20.[16]

Symphony Number One emphasizes inclusionary policies in orchestra membership, audience access, and selection of featured composers.[17][18] SNO is a two-time recipient of grants by Women's Philharmonic Advocacy for multiple commissions of female composers.[19][20]
