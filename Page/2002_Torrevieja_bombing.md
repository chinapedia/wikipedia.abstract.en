On August 9, 2002, the separatist Basque terrorist organization, ETA, placed an explosive in the toilets of a hamburger restaurant, located a few meters from a tourist office, the Alicante town of Torrevieja. No one died or was injured, although it caused serious material damage.[1]

ETA claimed responsibility for the attack through a call to the Basque newspaper _Gara_, which also said it had placed a bomb on the beach in Santa Pola, which was found days later in palm trees.[2][3]
