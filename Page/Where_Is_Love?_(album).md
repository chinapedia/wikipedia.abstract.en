_WHERE IS LOVE?_ is an album by vocalist Irene Kral performing with pianist Alan Broadbent which was recorded in 1974 and originally released on the Choice label and rereleased by Candid on CD in 1996.[1][2][3]


Reception

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow stated "This is a haunting program, Irene Kral's best; it sticks in one's memory long afterwards and can be considered one of the finest sets of ballads ever recorded. Essential music".[4] In JazzTimes Joe Seigal called the album "her creative breakthrough and, sadly, her artistic testament" and "A vocal classic".[5] On All About Jazz Michael P. Gladstone said "With just a spare piano accompaniment, the vocalist tackles nine very well chosen ballads that are meant not only to entertain us but to advise us about the compositions of singer-songwriters like Bob Dorough, Dave Frishberg and Blossom Dearie. ... Her unhurried and moving delivery opens up the lyrical content of show tunes like the title song from Oliver or Leslie Bricusse's "When I Look In Your Eyes."[6]
