JULIUS ADLER (23 January 1894 – 8 April 1945) was a German politician and member of the Communist Party of Germany. A member of the Reichstag from 1928 to 1933, he was later detained by the Gestapo and died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.


Life

Julius Adler was born in Neunkirchen, the son of a miner. By occupation a crane operator, he was also an active member and official within the Communist Party. In 1924 he became a city councillor in Hamborn and following the incorporation of the former into Duisburg, became a city councillor there. From 1928 to 1933 he was a member of the Reichstag.

After the Nazi seizure of power, Julius Adler was arrested on 15 March 1933 in Essen, taken into "protective custody", and imprisoned at the Lichtenburg concentration camp. According to an arrest warrant, he was imprisoned in Torgau from August 1934 onwards. On January 11, 1935, the Third Criminal Division of the High Regional Court Hamm (OLG Hamm) sentenced Adler to 18 months in prison for treason. The prosecution alleged that Adler had participated in three meetings of communist officials in March 1933. In 1937 he was discharged from Börgermoor concentration camp but was arrested twice again in the same year. After the beginning of the war in September 1939, Adler was arrested again by the Gestapo and imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In 1945 he was transported to Bergen-Belsen, where he died after contracting typhus. The exact date of his death is not known; in 1949 the Hamborn District Court ruled he had died on 8 April 1945.[1]
