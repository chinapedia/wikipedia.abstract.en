PETER GURALNICK (born December 15, 1943, in Boston, Massachusetts) is an American music critic, author, and screenwriter. He specializes in the history of early rock and roll and has written on Elvis Presley, Sam Phillips, and Sam Cooke.


Career

Guralnick graduated from Boston University in 1971 with a master's degree in creative writing. He then began writing books about the history of rock'n'roll, blues, country music, and soul music.

Guralnick's first two books, _Almost Grown_ (1964) and _Mister Downchild_ (1967), were collections of short stories published by the Larry Stark Press, a small press in Cambridge, Massachusetts, devoted to stories and poems. Mona Dickson, writing in MIT's _The Tech_ (May 13, 1964) gave _Almost Grown_ a favorable review.[1]

His two-volume biography of Elvis Presley, _Last Train to Memphis_ in 1994, followed by _Careless Love_ in 1999, placed the story of Presley's career into a rise and fall arc. Encompassing more than 1,300 pages (including 1,150 pages of text), the work was preceded by Presley's first biography by Jerry Hopkins in two important volumes, _Elvis_ in 1971 and _Elvis: The Final Years_ in 1980 and countered earlier biographies such as Albert Goldman's Elvis from 1981, with an in-depth, scholarly examination of Presley's life and music. Guralnick previously wrote about Presley in _The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll_, in its first edition, in 1976; his article has been reprinted in each subsequent edition. He also contributed the complete text for the 240-page hardcover book accompanying the 2010 30-disc CD boxed set, _The Complete Elvis Presley Masters_.

In contrast to contemporaries such as Lester Bangs, Ian Penman and Nick Tosches, whose music writings are marked by idiosyncratic, self-referential and highly personal styles, Guralnick's writing is characterized by a colloquial approach that is clean and understated by comparison.[2][3] He has been called "the dean of rock 'n' roll storytellers".[4]

Guralnick wrote the 727-page biography of influential record producer Sam Phillips entitled _Sam Phillips: The Man Who Invented Rock 'n' Roll_. He also penned the script for A&E's documentary of the same name, narrated by Billy Bob Thornton. On October 21, 2016, it was announced that Leonardo DiCaprio will portray Sam Phillips in the forthcoming film based on Guralnick's book.[5] Guralnick scripted _Sam Cooke – Legend_,[6] narrated by Jeffrey Wright.

He has written liner notes for albums including Charlie Rich's last album _Pictures and Paintings_ and the last three Jerry Lee Lewis albums _Last Man Standing_, _Mean Old Man_ and _Rock and Roll Time_.

The Peter Guralnick Collection is located in the Southern Folklife Collection of the Wilson Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.[7]


Personal life

Peter Guralnick's parents were Walter Guralnick, DMD, who helped to establish dental insurance in Massachusetts through Delta Dental, and Betty Marson Guralnick. In 1971, he succeeded his grandfather as director of an athletic camp for boys, Camp Alton. It was located on Lake Winnipesaukee in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. The camp closed in 1992.[8] He has been married for over 45 years to Alexandra. They have a son and daughter, Jacob and Nina.
