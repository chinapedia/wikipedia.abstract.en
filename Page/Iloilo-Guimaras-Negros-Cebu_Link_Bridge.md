The ILOILO-GUIMARAS-NEGROS-CEBU LINK BRIDGE is a planned network of bridges in the Visayas in the Philippines connecting the islands of Panay, Guimaras, Negros, and Cebu.

One of the core projects of the Duterte Administration's "Build, Build, Build" Program, the bridge network aims to provide increased inter-connectivity in the provinces of Western and Central Visayas, to stimulate economic activity in the region and help in the decongestion of Metro Manila in the process. Once complete, the bridge network's combined length will be longer than the current longest bridge in the country, San Juanico Bridge in the islands of Samar and Leyte.[1]


History

There were several proposals to build bridges linking the islands in the Visayas. In 1999, the Japan International Cooperation Agency created a master plan for two bridges connecting Panay, Guimaras, and Negros; the first bridge, spanning , was planned to link Leganes, Iloilo to Buenavista, Guimaras, and the second bridge measuring was meant to connect San Lorenzo, Guimaras to Pulupandan, Negros Occidental. The Department of Public Works and Highways conducted a study on building bridges that would connect Panay, Guimaras, and Negros which were projected to require a budget if the bridges are to be built.[2]

In 2013, Governors Alfredo Mara√±on Jr. of Negros Occidental and Arthur Defensor Sr. of Iloilo made a proposal to build a bridge that would link E.B. Magalona. Negros Occidental and Banate, Iloilo.[3]

A feasibility study conducted by the Philippine government that concluded in May 2018 divided the project into three phases: Phase I would start in Leganes, Iloilo and go to Buenavista, Guimaras, Phase II will be the Guimaras-Negros portion and Phase III the Negros-Cebu part.[4] Public Works and Highways secretary Mark Villar announced in August 2018 that Phase I of the project will likely start in late 2018 or early 2019, with the PhP 27.156 million needed for the project to be provided by the Chinese government through a grant.[5]
