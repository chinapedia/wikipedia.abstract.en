LUDVIG MOON is a pop-rock band from Oslo, Norway. The band started as a solo act in 2012 when Anders Magnor Killerud left Spellemannprisen-winning pop band Team Me to pursue his own music.[1] The band released their first songs on NRK Urørt. It was with these songs that they earned Urørt Ukas (Song of the Week) title on the NRK Urørt website. In 2014 they released their first EP which was self-titled. They released their debut studio album _Kin_ in October 2016.


Formation and early work (2012-2015)

Ludvig Moon made their concert debut in Oslo at the Gut Feelings festival in 2012. In 2013 the Norwegian indie record label, Furuberget released the bands' three song EP _Summer Glow-fi_ for free on the music sharing website, bandcamp.[2] It was this EP that earned Ludvig Moon the Urørt Ukas (Song of the week) title on NRK Urørt, which is a part of the Norwegian Broadcasting channel P3, with their song "Uneasy".[3]

Later in 2013 Ludvig Moon signed to Rallye Label in Japan and Riot Factory in Norway and released their self-titled EP in 2014, first in Japan, then in Norway and later worldwide. The album received many good reviews in leading Scandinavian publications. They received a 4 out of 6 in Gaffa Norway.[4] and were also featured in Under Dusken[5] and on Norwegian radio.

After the release of the EP, Ludvig Moon went on a Norway-wide tour supporting Team Me. The band stood out in 2015 at By:Larm festival and conference in Oslo by performing two concerts in one night at Verkstedet and then later the same night at John Dee. In 2015 the EP won frontman, Killerud, the Volumfestivalen Stipend, an award given to talented and promising musicians from Hedmark, Norway.[6]


_Kin_ (2016—present)

In October 2016 Ludvig Moon released their debut studio album _Kin_ worldwide with major releases in both digital and physical media in Norway and Japan. The album has been featured in Norwegian and Japanese media.

Leading up to the album release, the band released 3 singles. _Cult Baby_ and a double A-side single, _Sparks_/_Houses At Night_. Cult Baby was released with a music video directed by Norwegian director/artist/musician Simen Sandbæk Skari who later joined the band before the album was released and who also designed and created the artwork for Kin as well as the CD/vinyl releases.
