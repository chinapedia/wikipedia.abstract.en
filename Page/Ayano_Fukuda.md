Biography

Fukuda graduated from Toyota City Late Field Junior High School and Aichi Prefectural Toyono High School.[3] During middle school she was the vice president of the student council and in high school she worked in the cheerleader dance circle.[4]

After graduating from high school Fukuda worked at local supermarket stores and aesthetic salons[5] and worked as a temporary staff at Toyota. Later in 2009 she was unemployed from Lehman Brothers due to its bankruptcy aftermath. Fukuda later aimed for _Amuse Zenkoku Audition 2009: The Push! Man: Anata no Mawari no Ike Teruko Boshū_ by the talent agency Amuse, Inc. She was submitted and was given the Variety Award among 31,514 people which made her debut.[6]

Fukuda's targeting entertainer is Tsutomu Sekine. When she appeared during the 16 March 2016 broadcast of the Tokyo Broadcasting System series _Hanamaru Market_'s "Hanamaru Cafe", she was given a supported comment by Sekine in which she became tearful.

In November 2015 Fukuda was appointed to the _We Love Toyota: Special Supporter_ in her hometown Toyota.[7]
