The FUERSTE HOUSE is a historic building located in Guttenberg, Iowa, United States. The two-story brick structure was built about 1870 in the vernacular Greek Revival style.[1] The screened-in porch on the west side was enclosed at some point. Mrs. L. Fuerst operated a millinery shop on the first floor of the family residence by at least 1891. The Fuerst family operated a machine shop across the street. The building was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.[2] In 2004 it was included as a contributing property in the Front Street (River Park Drive) Historic District.[3]
