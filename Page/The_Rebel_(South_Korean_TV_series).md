Synopsis

Set during the reign of famous tyrant King Yeonsangun, it tells the story of Hong Gil-dong, the son of a servant who stole from the rich and gave to the poor, and his journey in becoming Joseon's first revolutionary activist.

Hong Gil Dong (Yoon Kyun-sang) is the son of servant Hong Ah Mo Gae, which gives Gil Dong no legal standing in Joseon society. With no opportunities to do any legitimate work despite his brilliance, Gil Dong becomes the leader of a band of smugglers who steals from the rich to give to the poor. Gil Dong's contemporary, Yi Yung, becomes the tyrannical King Yeonsangun (Kim Ji-seok) who oppresses the lives of the common people. The king's faithful consort is Jang Nok Soo (Lee Hanee), who secretly can't forget her first love, Gil Dong.
