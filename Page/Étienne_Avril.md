ÉTIENNE AVRIL (1748-1791) was a French furniture designer, or ébéniste.


Early life

Étienne Avril was born in 1748.[1] He had two brothers, both of whom also became ébénistes.[2]


Career

As an ébéniste, Avril mostly designed rectangular mahogany panels, framed by bronze.[3] He became a maître-ébéniste, or master furniture designer, in 1774.[4] A year later, in 1775, he began adding porcelain to the design of his furniture.[5] For example, he added two nymphs made of bisque to a wardrobe he designed for the Palace of Fontainebleau.[6] Other notable pieces of furniture include a marquetry desk with a glass door for the Mirault family, and a mahogany guéridons with leg made of gilded bronze for the Sené family.[7]
