PETER MICHAEL FALK (September 16, 1927 – June 23, 2011) was an American actor, known for his role as Lieutenant Columbo in the long-running television series _Columbo_ (1968–2003), for which he won four Primetime Emmy Awards (1972, 1975, 1976, 1990) and a Golden Globe Award (1973). He first starred as Columbo in two 90-minute TV pilots; the first with Gene Barry in 1968 and the second with Lee Grant in 1971. The show then aired as part of _The NBC Mystery Movie_ series from 1971 to 1978, and again on ABC from 1989 to 2003.[1]

Falk was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, for _Murder, Inc._ (1960) and _Pocketful of Miracles_ (1961), and won his first Emmy Award in 1962 for _The Dick Powell Theatre_. He was the first actor to be nominated for an Academy Award and an Emmy Award in the same year, achieving the feat twice (1961/62). He went on to appear in such films as _It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World_ (1963), _The Great Race_ (1965), _Anzio_ (1968), _A Woman Under the Influence_ (1974), _Murder by Death_ (1976), _Mikey and Nicky_ (1976), _The Cheap Detective_ (1978), _The Princess Bride_ (1987), _Wings of Desire_ (1987), _The Player_ (1992), and _Next_ (2007), as well as many television guest roles.

Director William Friedkin said of Falk's role in his film _The Brink's Job_ (1978): "Peter has a great range from comedy to drama. He could break your heart or he could make you laugh."[2] In 1996, _TV Guide_ ranked Falk No. 21 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list.[3] He received posthumously a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2013.[4][5]


Early life

Born in New York City, Falk was the son of Michael Peter Falk (1898-1981), owner of a clothing and dry goods store, and his wife, Madeline (née Hochhauser; 1904–2001),[6] an accountant and buyer.[7] Both of his parents were Jewish,[8] coming from Poland and Russia on his father's side,[9] and from Hungary and Łabowa, Nowy Sącz County, Poland, on his mother's side. Falk grew up in Ossining, New York.[10]

Falk's right eye was surgically removed when he was three because of a retinoblastoma; he wore an artificial eye for most of his life.[11] The artificial eye was the cause of his trademark squint.[12] Despite this limitation, as a boy he participated in team sports, mainly baseball and basketball. In a 1997 interview in _Cigar Aficionado_ magazine with Arthur Marx, Falk said: "I remember once in high school the umpire called me out at third base when I was sure I was safe. I got so mad I took out my glass eye, handed it to him and said, 'Try this.' I got such a laugh you wouldn't believe."[13]

Falk's first stage appearance was at the age of 12 in _The Pirates of Penzance_ at Camp High Point[14] in upstate New York, where one of his camp counselors was Ross Martin (they would later act together in _The Great Race_ and the _Columbo_ episode "Suitable For Framing"). Falk attended Ossining High School in Westchester County, New York, where he was a star athlete and president of his senior class. After graduating from high school in 1945, Falk briefly attended Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, and then tried to join the armed services as World War II was drawing to a close. Rejected because of his missing eye, he joined the United States Merchant Marine, and served as a cook and mess boy. Falk said of the experience in 1997: "There they don't care if you're blind or not. The only one on a ship who has to see is the captain. And in the case of the _Titanic_, he couldn't see very well, either."[15] Falk recalls this period in his autobiography: "A year on the water was enough for me, so I returned to college. I didn't stay long. Too itchy. What to do next? I signed up to go to Israel to fight in the war on its attack on Egypt; I wasn't passionate about Israel, I wasn't passionate about Egypt, I just wanted more excitement… I got assigned a ship and departure date but the war was over before the ship ever sailed."

After a year and a half in the Merchant Marine, Falk returned to Hamilton College and also attended the University of Wisconsin. He transferred to the New School for Social Research in New York City, which awarded him a bachelor's degree in literature and political science in 1951. He then traveled in Europe and worked on a railroad in Yugoslavia for six months. He returned to New York, enrolling at Syracuse University,[16] but he recalled in his 2006 memoir, _Just One More Thing_, that he was unsure what he wanted to do with his life for years after leaving high school.

Falk obtained a Master of Public Administration degree at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University in 1953. The program was designed to train civil servants for the federal government, a career that Falk said in his memoir he had "no interest in and no aptitude for". He applied for a job with the CIA, but was rejected because of his membership in the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union while serving in the Merchant Marine, even though he was required to join and was not active in the union (which had been under fire for communist leanings). He then became a management analyst with the Connecticut State Budget Bureau in Hartford.[17] In 1997, Falk characterized his Hartford job as "efficiency expert": "I was such an efficiency expert that the first morning on the job, I couldn't find the building where I was to report for work. Naturally, I was late, which I always was in those days, but ironically it was my tendency never to be on time that got me started as a professional actor."[18]


Career

Stage career

While working in Hartford, Falk joined a community theater group called the Mark Twain Masquers, where he performed in plays that included _The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial_, _The Crucible_, and _The Country Girl_ by Clifford Odets. Falk also studied with Eva Le Gallienne, who was giving an acting class at the White Barn Theatre in Westport, Connecticut. Falk later recalled how he "lied his way" into the class, which was for professional actors. He drove down to Westport from Hartford every Wednesday, when the classes were held, and was usually late.[19] In his 1997 interview with Arthur Marx in _Cigar Aficionado_ Magazine, Falk said of Le Gallienne: "One evening when I arrived late, she looked at me and asked, 'Young man, why are you always late?' and I said, 'I have to drive down from Hartford.'" She looked down her nose and said, "What do you do in Hartford? There's no theater there. How do you make a living acting?" Falk confessed he wasn't a professional actor. According to him Le Gallienne looked at him sternly and said: "Well, you should be." He drove back to Hartford and quit his job.[20] Falk stayed with the Le Gallienne group for a few months more, and obtained a letter of recommendation from Le Galliene to an agent at the William Morris Agency in New York.[21] In 1956, he left his job with the Budget Bureau and moved to Greenwich Village to pursue an acting career.[22]

Falk's first New York stage role was in an Off-Broadway production of Molière's _Don Juan_ at the Fourth Street Theatre that closed after its only performance on January 3, 1956. Falk played the second lead, Sganarelle.[23] His next theater role proved far better for his career. In May, he appeared at Circle in the Square in a revival of _The Iceman Cometh_ with Jason Robards playing the bartender.[24][25]

Later in 1956, Falk made his Broadway debut, appearing in Alexander Ostrovsky's _Diary of a Scoundrel_. As the year came to an end, he appeared again on Broadway as an English soldier in Shaw's _Saint Joan_ with Siobhán McKenna.[26]

In 1972, Falk appeared in Broadway's _The Prisoner of Second Avenue_. According to film historian Ephraim Katz: "His characters derive added authenticity from his squinty gaze, the result of the loss of an eye ...".[27]

Early films

Despite his stage success, a theatrical agent advised Falk not to expect much film acting work because of his artificial eye.[28] He failed a screen test at Columbia Pictures and was told by studio boss Harry Cohn: "For the same price I can get an actor with two eyes." He also failed to get a role in the film _Marjorie Morningstar_, despite a promising interview for the second lead.[29] His first film performances were in small roles in _Wind Across the Everglades_ (1958), _The Bloody Brood_ (1959) and _Pretty Boy Floyd_ (1960). Falk's performance in _Murder, Inc._ (1960) was a turning point in his career. He was cast in the supporting role of killer Abe Reles in a film based on the real-life murder gang of that name that terrorized New York in the 1930s. _The New York Times_ film critic Bosley Crowther, while dismissing the movie as "an average gangster film", singled out Falk's "amusingly vicious performance".[30] Crowther wrote:[31]

The film turned out to be Falk's breakout role. In his autobiography, _Just One More Thing_ (2006), Falk said his selection for the film from thousands of other Off-Broadway actors was a "miracle" that "made my career" and that without it, he would not have received the other significant movie roles that he later played.[32] Falk, who played Reles again in the 1960 TV series _The Witness_, was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his performance in the film.

in _Penelope_ (1966)]] In 1961, multiple Academy Award-winning director Frank Capra cast Falk in the comedy _Pocketful of Miracles_. The film was Capra's last feature, and although it was not the commercial success he hoped it would be, he "gushed about Falk's performance".[33] Falk was nominated for an Oscar for the role. In his autobiography, Capra wrote about Falk:

For his part, Falk says he "never worked with a director who showed greater enjoyment of actors and the acting craft. There is nothing more important to an actor than to know that the one person who represents the audience to you, the director, is responding well to what you are trying to do." Falk once recalled how Capra reshot a scene even though he yelled "Cut and Print," indicating the scene was finalized. When Falk asked him why he wanted it reshot: "He laughed and said that he loved the scene so much he just wanted to see us do it again. How's that for support!"[34]

For the remainder of the 1960s, Falk had mainly supporting movie roles and TV guest-starring appearances. Falk turned in a gem of a performance as one of two cabbies who falls victim to greed in the epic 1963 star-studded comedy _It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World_, although he only appears in the last fifth of the movie. His other roles included the character of Guy Gisborne in the Rat Pack musical comedy _Robin and the 7 Hoods_ (1964), in which he sings one of the film's numbers, and the spoof _The Great Race_ (1965) with Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis.

Early television roles

'' (1959)]] Falk first appeared on television in 1957, in the dramatic anthology programs that later became known as the "Golden Age of Television". In 1957, he appeared in one episode of _Robert Montgomery Presents._ He was also cast in _Studio One,_ _Kraft Television Theater,_ _New York Confidential,_ _Naked City,_ _The Untouchables_, _Have Gun–Will Travel,_ _The Islanders,_ and _Decoy_ with Beverly Garland cast as the first female police officer in a series lead. On _The Twilight Zone_ he portrayed a Castro-type revolutionary complete with beard who, intoxicated with power, kept seeing his would-be assassins in a newly acquired magic mirror. He starred in two of Alfred Hitchcock's television series, as a gangster terrified of death in a 1961 episode of _Alfred Hitchcock Presents_ and as a homicidal evangelist in 1962's _The Alfred Hitchcock Hour_.

In 1961, Falk was nominated for an _Emmy Award_[35] for his performance in the episode "Cold Turkey" of James Whitmore's short-lived series _The Law and Mr. Jones_ on ABC. On September 29, 1961, Falk and Walter Matthau guest-starred in the premiere episode, "The Million Dollar Dump", of ABC's crime drama _Target: The Corruptors_, with Stephen McNally and Robert Harland. He won an Emmy for _The Price of Tomatoes_, a drama carried in 1962 on _The Dick Powell Show_.

In 1963, Falk and Tommy Sands appeared as brothers who disagreed on the route for a railroad in "The Gus Morgan Story" on ABC's _Wagon Train_. Falk played the title role of "Gus", and Sands was his younger brother, Ethan Morgan. Ethan accidentally shoots wagonmaster Chris Hale, played by John McIntire, while the brothers are in the mountains looking at possible route options. Gus makes the decision to leave Hale behind- even choking him, believing he is dead. Ethan has been overcome with oxygen deprivation and needs Gus' assistance to reach safety down the mountain. Unknown to the Morgans, Hale crawls down the mountain through snow, determined to obtain revenge against Gus. In time, though, Hale comes to understand the difficult choice Morgan had to make, and the brothers reconcile their own differences. This episode is remembered for its examination of how far a man will persist amid adversity to preserve his own life and that of his brother.[36]

Falk's first television series was in the title role of the drama _The Trials of O'Brien_, in which he played a lawyer. The show ran in 1965 and 1966 and was cancelled after 22 episodes. In 1966, he also co-starred in a television production of "Brigadoon" with Robert Goulet.

In 1971, Pierre Cossette produced the first Grammy Awards show on television with some help from Falk. Cossette writes in his autobiography, "What meant the most to me, though, is the fact that Peter Falk saved my ass. I love show business, and I love Peter Falk."[37]

_Columbo_

Although Falk appeared in numerous other television roles in the 1960s and 1970s, he is best known as the star of the TV series _Columbo_, "everyone's favorite rumpled television detective".[38] His character was a shabby and ostensibly absent-minded police detective lieutenant driving a Peugeot 403, who had first appeared in the 1968 film _Prescription: Murder_. Rather than a whodunit, the show typically revealed the murderer from the beginning, then showed how the Los Angeles police detective Columbo went about solving the crime. Falk would describe his role to Fantle:

Television critic Ben Falk (no relation) added that Falk "created an iconic cop… who always got his man (or woman) after a tortuous cat-and-mouse investigation". He also noted the idea for the character was "apparently inspired by Dostoyevsky's dogged police inspector, Porfiry Petrovich, in the novel _Crime and Punishment_.[39]

Falk tries to analyze the character and notes the correlation between his own personality and Columbo's:

With "general amazement", Falk notes: "The show is all over the world. I've been to little villages in Africa with maybe one TV set, and little kids will run up to me shouting, 'Columbo, Columbo!'"[40] Singer Johnny Cash recalled acting in one episode, and although he was not an experienced actor, he writes in his autobiography: "Peter Falk was good to me. I wasn't at all confident about handling a dramatic role, and every day he helped me in all kinds of little ways."[41]

The first episode of _Columbo_ as a series was directed in 1971 by a 24-year-old Steven Spielberg in one of his earliest directing jobs. Falk recalled the episode to Spielberg biographer Joseph McBride:

The character of Columbo had previously been played by Bert Freed in a single television episode of _The Chevy Mystery Show_ in 1960, and by Thomas Mitchell on Broadway. Falk first played Columbo in _Prescription: Murder_, a 1968 TV movie, and the 1970 pilot for the series, _Ransom for a Dead Man_. From 1971 to 1978, _Columbo_ aired regularly on NBC as part of the umbrella series _NBC Mystery Movie_. All episodes were of TV movie length, in a 90- or 120-minute slot including commercials. In 1989, the show returned on ABC in the form of a less frequent series of TV movies, still starring Falk, airing until 2003. Falk won four Emmys for his role as Columbo.[42]

_Columbo_ was so popular, co-creator William Link wrote a series of short stories published as _The Columbo Collection_ (Crippen & Landru, 2010) which includes a drawing by Falk of himself as Columbo, and the cover features a caricature of Falk/Columbo by Al Hirschfeld.[43]

Later career

Falk was a close friend of independent film director John Cassavetes and appeared in his films _Husbands_, _A Woman Under the Influence_, and, in a cameo, at the end of _Opening Night_. Cassavetes guest-starred in the _Columbo_ episode "Étude in Black" in 1972; Falk, in turn, co-starred with Cassavetes in the 1976 film _Mikey and Nicky_. Falk describes his experiences working with Cassavetes, specifically remembering his directing strategies: "Shooting an actor when he might be unaware the camera was running."

In 1978, Falk appeared on the comedy TV show _The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast_, portraying his Columbo character, with Frank Sinatra the evening's victim.[44]

Falk continued to work in films, including his performance as a questionable ex-CIA agent of dubious sanity in the comedy _The In-Laws_. Director Arthur Hiller said during an interview that the "film started out because Alan Arkin and Peter Falk wanted to work together. They went to Warner Brother's and said, 'We'd like to do a picture', and Warner said fine ... and out came _The In-laws_ ... of all the films I've done, _The In-laws_ is the one I get the most comments on."[45] Movie critic Roger Ebert compared the film with a later remake:

Falk appeared in _The Great Muppet Caper_, _The Princess Bride_, _Murder by Death_, _The Cheap Detective_, _Vibes_, _Made_, and in Wim Wenders' 1987 German language film _Wings of Desire_ and its 1993 sequel, _Faraway, So Close!._ In _Wings of Desire_, Falk played a semi-fictionalized version of himself, a famous American actor who had once been an angel, but who had grown disillusioned with only observing life on Earth and had in turn given up his immortality. Falk described the role as "the craziest thing that I've ever been offered", but he earned critical acclaim for his supporting performance in the film.[46]

In 1998, Falk returned to the New York stage to star in an Off-Broadway production of Arthur Miller's _Mr. Peters' Connections_. His previous stage work included shady real estate salesman Shelley "the Machine" Levine in the 1986 Boston/Los Angeles production of David Mamet's prizewinning _Glengarry Glen Ross_.[47]

Falk starred in a trilogy of holiday television movies – _A Town Without Christmas_ (2001), _Finding John Christmas_ (2003), and _When Angels Come to Town_ (2004) – in which he portrayed Max, a quirky guardian angel who uses disguises and subterfuge to steer his charges onto the right path. In 2005, he starred in _The Thing About My Folks_. Although movie critic Roger Ebert was not impressed with most of the other actors, he wrote in his review: "... We discover once again what a warm and engaging actor Peter Falk is. I can't recommend the movie, but I can be grateful that I saw it, for Falk."[48] In 2007, Falk appeared with Nicolas Cage in the thriller _Next_.


Personal life

Falk married Alyce Mayo whom he met when the two were students at Syracuse University,[49] on April 17, 1960. The couple adopted two daughters, Catherine (who was to become a private investigator) and Jackie. Falk and his wife divorced in 1976. On December 7, 1977, he married actress Shera Danese,[50] who guest-starred on the _Columbo_ series on numerous occasions.

Falk was an accomplished artist, and in October 2006 he had an exhibition of his artwork at the Butler Institute of American Art.[51] He took classes at the Art Students League of New York for many years.[52][53]

Falk was a chess aficionado and a spectator at the American Open in Santa Monica, California, in November 1972, and at the U.S. Open in Pasadena, California, in August 1983.[54]

His memoir _Just One More Thing_ () was published by Carroll & Graf on August 23, 2006.


Health

, Hungary]] Rumors of Falk's dementia plagued the actor in the final years of his life and were exacerbated when in late April 2008 he was photographed by paparazzi looking disheveled and acting animated in the streets of Beverly Hills. Although the actor said his behavior resulted from his frustration over being unable to remember where he had parked his car, the images of his erratic appearance and behavior were published by the media; Falk was seldom seen in public after the incident.[55]

In December 2008 it was reported that Falk had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.[56] In June 2009, at a two-day conservatorship trial in Los Angeles, one of Falk's personal physicians, Dr. Stephen Read, reported he had rapidly slipped into dementia after a series of dental operations in 2007.[57] Dr. Read said it was unclear whether Falk's condition had worsened as a result of anesthesia or some other reaction to the operations. Shera Danese Falk was appointed as her husband's conservator.[58]

Death

On the evening of June 23, 2011, Falk died at his longtime home on Roxbury Drive in Beverly Hills at the age of 83.[59][60] His death was primarily caused by pneumonia, with complications of Alzheimer's disease being a secondary and underlying cause.[61] His daughters said they would remember his "wisdom and humor".[62] Falk's body was buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.[63]

His death was marked by tributes from many film celebrities including Jonah Hill, Roger Ebert, and Stephen Fry[64][65] Steven Spielberg said, "I learned more about acting from him at that early stage of my career than I had from anyone else."[66] Rob Reiner said: "He was a completely unique actor", and went on to say that Falk's work with Alan Arkin in _The In-Laws_ was "one of the most brilliant comedy pairings we've seen on screen".[67]


Peter Falk's Law

Shera Danese was Falk's second wife and conservator, and allegedly, according to his daughter Catherine, stopped some of his family members from visiting him, did not notify them of major changes in his condition, and did not notify them of his death and funeral arrangements. Catherine later encouraged the passage of legislation called Peter Falk's Law, that provides guidelines that guardians and conservators for an incapacitated person must comply with regarding visitation rights and notice of death.[68][69][70] As of 2016 over ten states had enacted such laws.[71]
