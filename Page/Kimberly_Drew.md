KIMBERLY DREW (born 1990)[1] is a curator of "black art and experiences"[2], as well as the creator of the popular Tumblr blog "Black Contemporary Art".[3][4]. She previously held the position of social media manager for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Drew supplements the Tumblr with accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, which she uses to champion black artists and the cause of Black Lives Matter.[5][6]


Early life

Drew grew up in Orange, New Jersey,[7] and currently lives in Brooklyn, New York City.[8]

Growing up, she was raised in a family of artists.[9] In 2008, Drew graduated from the boarding school St. George's School in Middletown, Rhode Island.[10] During her second year at Smith College, Drew had an internship at Studio Museum in Harlem with Thelma Golden, which influenced her later choice of concentration.[11] She said the experience of working in a museum informed her career path. In 2012, Drew graduated from Smith College with a B.A. in Art history and Africana studies, and a concentration in Museum Studies.[12]


Career

In March 2011, Drew started the Tumblr blog called "Black Contemporary Art" while still in college.[13] When she began "Black Contemporary Art," Drew would write posts for black artists who were featured on museum websites but not on Tumblr so that they "were part of a recorded history."[14] As such, she aims to help "more marginalized people enter institutions, learn the rules, and shatter and restructure them."[15]

In 2012, she worked at Creative Time in New York.[16] In July 2015, Drew was hired as the Associate Online Community Producer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.[17]

In 2016, Drew was invited to curate the White House's Instagram account during the 2016 South by South Lawn festival.[18][19] Additionally, Drew worked with the Aperture Foundation as a social media consultant.[20][21] Artsy included her in a roundup of art-world leaders who are "advancing racial equality in the art world."

Additionally in July 2016, Drew, along with writers Taylor Renee Aldridge and Jessica Lynne and art historian Jessica Bell Brown, organized a project called Black Art Incubator,[22] a two-month long program of book exchanges, art critiques, and panel discussions which aimed to 'â€™prioritize Black subjectivity through the use of social sculpture."[23] In 2017, Drew served as a juror for the Artadia Awards.[24]

Drew is co-authoring a book with Jenna Wortham,[25] _The Black Futures Project,_ which will examine how creativity relates to black cultural identity[26] and will be published by Chris Jackson's One World imprint at Random House in July of 2019. _The Black Futures Project_ is an anthology inspired by _The Black Book_ by Toni Morrison and will take the form of a "coffee table book."[27]
