GARY J. TUNNICLIFFE (born 27 February 1968)[1] is a British special make-up effects designer, writer, and director. He has performed make-up effects in all the _Hellraiser_ films since _Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth_, wrote _Hellraiser: Revelations_, and wrote and directed _Hellraiser: Judgment_. His other make-up credits include _Candyman_, _Wishmaster_, the _Dracula 2000_ series, the _Pulse_ series, and _Feast_.


Career

Tunnicliffe started out performing special make-up effects. After collaborating with Bob Keen on make-up effects for writer-director Anthony Hickox's _Waxwork II: Lost in Time_ (1992), he joined them again for Hickox's next project, _Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth_ (1992). Special effects technician Kevin Yagher, when selected to direct _Hellraiser: Bloodline_ (1996), contacted Tunnicliffe to perform the special effects on that film. Tunnicliffe was surprised Yagher was not performing the effects work himself, but Yagher believed Tunnicliffe's experience with the prior film would be valuable. Tunnicliffe returned for Scott Derrickson's _Hellraiser: Inferno_ (2000) and Rick Bota's _Hellraiser: Hellseeker_ (2002). He again collaborated with Bota in the next two sequels, both released in 2005. In _Hellraiser: Deader_, he also directed the second unit and had a cameo appearance. In _Hellraiser: Hellworld_, Tunnicliffe performed special effects, make-up effects, and collected the _Hellraiser_ memorabilia used in the film. Tunnicliffe appeared in the film as a Cenobite and, briefly, without make-up near the end. In _Hellraiser: Revelations_ (2011), he wrote the script for director Víctor García. He wrote and directed the tenth _Hellraiser_ sequel, _Judgment_.[2]

In addition to his work on the _Hellraiser_ films, Tunnicliffe has worked with Clive Barker on _Candyman_ (1992)[3] and _Lord of Illusions_ (1995).[4] Tunnicliffe has also worked with Patrick Lussier on several films, including the _Dracula 2000_ series,[5] _My Bloody Valentine 3D_ (2009),[6] and _Drive Angry_ (2011).[7] Other franchises include _Pulse_ (2006) and its sequels, _Mimic 2_ (2001) and _Mimic 3: Sentinel_ (2003), and _Scream 4_ (2011).[8] Besides _Hellraiser: Judgment_, Tunnicliffe's feature directing work includes the fairy tale films _Hansel and Gretel_ (2002) and _Jack and the Beanstalk_ (2009).[9][10] He also directed the short films _No More Souls_ and _The Chicken Run_,[11] which are set in the _Hellraiser_ and _The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_ universes, respectively.
