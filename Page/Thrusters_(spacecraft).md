A THRUSTER is a propulsive device used by spacecraft for station keeping, attitude control, in the reaction control system, or long-duration, low-thrust acceleration. A VERNIER ENGINE or GIMBAL ENGINE is a particular case used on launch vehicles where a secondary rocket or other high thrust device is used to control the attitude of the rocket while the primary thrust engine (generally also a rocket engine) is fixed to the rocket and supplies the principal amount of thrust.[1][2][3][4][5]

Some devices that are use or proposed to use as thrusters are:

-   Cold gas thruster
-   Electrohydrodynamic thruster, using ionized air (only for use in an atmosphere)
-   Electrodeless plasma thruster, electric propulsion using ponderomotive force
-   Electrostatic ion thruster, using high-voltage electrodes
-   Hall effect thruster, a type of ion thruster
-   Ion thruster, using beams of ions accelerated electrically
-   Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster, electric propulsion using the Lorentz force
-   Pulsed inductive thruster, a pulsed form of ion thruster
-   Pulsed plasma thruster, using current arced across a solid propellant
-   RF resonant cavity thruster, an electromagnetic thruster using microwaves
-   Rocket engine, using exothermic chemical reactions of the propellant(s)
