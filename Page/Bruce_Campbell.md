Early life

Campbell was born in Royal Oak, Michigan,[3] the son of Joanne Louise (née Pickens), a homemaker, and Charles Newton Campbell (1928-2004), who worked in advertising for 35 years in roles ranging from traveling billboard inspector to company vice-president, later teaching at nine colleges as an adjunct professor, and was also an actor and director in local theater.[4]

Career

Early years

'' at a fan meet-and-greet]] Campbell began acting as a teenager and soon began making short Super 8 movies with friends. After meeting Sam Raimi in Wylie E. Groves High School, the two became very good friends and started making movies together. Campbell would go on to attend Western Michigan University while he continued to work on his acting career.[7] Campbell and Raimi collaborated on a 30-minute Super 8 version of the first _Evil Dead_ film, titled _Within the Woods_, which was initially used to attract investors.

Major film roles

A few years later, Campbell and Raimi got together with family and friends and began work on _The Evil Dead_. Campbell starred and worked behind the camera, receiving a "co-executive producer" credit. Raimi wrote, directed and edited, while fellow Michigander Rob Tapert was producer. Following an endorsement by horror writer Stephen King, the film slowly began to receive distribution.[8] Four years following its original release, it became the number one movie in the UK. It then received distribution in the United States, spawning two sequels: _Evil Dead II_ and _Army of Darkness_.

Campbell was also drawn in the Marvel Zombie comics as his character, Ash Williams. He is featured in five comics, all in the series _Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness_. In them, he fights alongside the Marvel heroes against the heroes and people who have turned into zombies (deadites) while in search of the Necronomicon (Book of the Names of the Dead).

He has appeared in many of Raimi's films outside of the _Evil Dead_ series, notably having cameos in the director's _Spider-Man_ film series. Campbell also joined the cast in Raimi's _Darkman_ and _The Quick and the Dead_, though having no actual screen time in the latter film's theatrical cut.

Campbell often takes on quirky roles, such as Elvis Presley in the film _Bubba Ho-Tep_. Along with _Bubba Ho-Tep_, he played a supporting role in _Maniac Cop_ and _Maniac Cop 2_, and spoofed his career in the self-directed _My Name is Bruce._

Other mainstream films for Campbell include supporting or featured roles in the Coen Brothers film _The Hudsucker Proxy_, the Michael Crichton adaptation _Congo_, the film version of _McHale's Navy_, _Escape From L.A._ (the sequel to John Carpenter's _Escape From New York_), the Jim Carrey drama _The Majestic_ and the 2005 Disney film _Sky High_.

Campbell had a starring voice role in the hit 2009 animated adaptation of the children's book _Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs_, and a supporting voice role in Pixar's _Cars 2_.

In January 2010, he stated in an interview that his new film project is called _Bruce vs. Frankenstein_.,[9] a sequel to My Name is Bruce. The film would have been directed and produced by his friend Mike Richardson.[10] It was later cancelled.

Campbell produced the remake of _The Evil Dead_, along with Raimi and Rob Tapert. Campbell made an appearance that may allude to his signature character, Ash, with the expectation he would reprise that role in _Army of Darkness 2_.[11] In a later interview with TV personality Erin Ashley Darling, Campbell announced that _Army of Darkness 2_ is not happening, saying "It's all internet B.S. There's no reality whatsoever. These random comments slip out of either my mouth, or Sam Raimi's mouth, next thing you know, we're making a sequel." In September 2017, during a panel at Fan Expo Canada, when asked if audiences could expect 4th _Evil Dead_ film, Campbell said "Everybody says Evil Dead 4! Evil Dead 4! You know, if we did an Evil Dead 4, Sam Raimi would spend $200 million on it, and it would bomb.",[12] elaborating that the only future for _Evil Dead_ is unrestricted distribution via a premium cable network, as _Ash vs Evil Dead_ is on Starz.[13]

Television roles

Outside of film, Campbell has appeared in a number of television series. He starred in _The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr._ a boisterous science fiction comedy western created by Jeffrey Boam and Carlton Cuse that ran for one season.

He starred in the television series _Jack of All Trades_, set on a fictional island occupied by the French in 1801. Campbell was also credited as co-executive producer, among others. The show was directed by Eric Gruendemann, and was produced by various people, including Sam Raimi. The show aired for two seasons, from 2000 to 2001. He had a recurring role as "Bill Church Jr." based upon the character of Morgan Edge from the Superman comics on _Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman_.

He portrayed Sam Axe, a beer-chugging, former Navy SEAL now working as an unlicensed private investigator and occasional mercenary with his old friend Michael Westen, the show's main character. When working undercover, his character frequently used the alias Chuck Finley, which Bruce later revealed was the name of one of his father's old co-workers.[14] Campbell was the star of a 2011 _Burn Notice_ made-for-television prequel focusing on Sam's Navy SEAL career, titled _Burn Notice: The Fall of Sam Axe_.

In 2014, Campbell played Santa Claus in an episode of _The Librarians_. Campbell played Ronald Reagan in season 2 of the FX original series _Fargo_. More recently Campbell reprised his role as Ashley "Ash" Williams in _Ash vs Evil Dead_, a series based upon the _Evil Dead_ franchise that launched his career. _Ash vs Evil Dead_ began airing on Starz on October 31, 2015, and was renewed by the cable channel for second[15] and third seasons,[16] before being cancelled.

In January 2019, Travel Channel announced a reboot of the _Ripley's Believe It or Not!_ reality series, with Bruce Campbell serving as host and executive producer. The 10-episode season debuted on June 9, 2019.[17]

Writing

In addition to acting and occasionally directing, Campbell has become a writer, starting with an autobiography, _If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor_, published on August 24, 2002.[21] The autobiography was a successful _New York Times_ Best Seller.[22] The paperback version of the book adds a chapter about the reaction of fans at book signings.

  "Whenever I do mainstream stuff, I think they're pseudo-interested, but they're still interested in seeing weirdo, offbeat stuff, and that's what I'm attracted to".

_If Chins Could Kill_ follows Campbell's career to date as an actor in low-budget films and television, providing his insight into "Blue-Collar Hollywood".

Campbell's next book, _Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way_ was published on May 26, 2005. The book's plot involves Bruce (depicted in a comical way) as the main character struggling to make it into the world of A-list movies. He later recorded an audio play adaptation of _Make Love_ with fellow Michigan actors, including longtime collaborator Ted Raimi. This radio drama was released through the independent label Rykodisc and spans 6 discs with a 6-hour running time.

In addition to his books, Campbell also wrote a column for _X Ray Magazine_ in 2001, an issue of the popular comic series _The Hire_, and comic book adaptations of his _Man with the Screaming Brain_. Most recently he wrote the introduction to Josh Becker's _The Complete Guide to Low-Budget Feature Filmmaking_.

In late 2016, Campbell announced that he would be releasing a third book, _Hail to the Chin: Further Confessions of a B Movie Actor,_ which will detail his life from where _If Chins Could Kill_ left off. _Hail to the Chin_ was released in August 2017, and accompanied by a book tour across the United States and Europe.[23]

Campbell maintained a blog on his official website, where he posted mainly about politics and the film industry.[24] The blog has since been discontinued.
