CANNABIS IN ECUADOR is legal for personal consumption in quantities of up to 10 grams. The sale of marijuana is illegal.

According to the 2008 Constitution of Ecuador in its Article 364 the Ecuadorian state does not see drug consumption as a crime but only as a health concern.[1] Since June 2013 the State drugs regulatory office CONSEP has published a table which establishes maximum quantities carried by persons so as to be considered in legal possession and that person as not a seller of drugs.[2][3][4] The amount of cannabis that is allowed as personal consumption quantity is 10 grams of marijuana or hash.[5]
