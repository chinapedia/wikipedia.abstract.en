Eris_(Discordia).jpg, the Greek goddess of discord]]

DISCORDIANISM is a paradigm based upon the book _Principia Discordia,_[1] written by Greg Hill with Kerry Wendell Thornley in 1963, the two working under the pseudonyms Malaclypse the Younger and Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst. According to self-proclaimed "crackpot historian" Adam Gorightly, Discordianism was founded as a parody religion. Many outside observers still regard Discordianism as a parody religion, although some of its adherents may utilize it as a legitimate religion or as a metaphor for a governing philosophy.[2]

The _Principia Discordia_, if read literally, encourages the worship of the Greek goddess Eris, known in Latin as Discordia, the goddess of disorder, or archetypes and ideals associated with her. Depending on the version of Discordianism, Eris might be considered the goddess exclusively of disorder or the goddess of disorder and chaos. Both views are supported by the _Principia Discordia_. The _Principia Discordia_ holds three core principles: the Aneristic (order), the Eristic (disorder), and the notion that both are mere illusions. Due to these principles, a Discordian believes there is no distinction between disorder and chaos, since the only difference between the two is that one refers to 'order'. An argument presented by the text is that it is only by rejecting these principles that you can truly perceive reality as it is, chaos.

It is difficult to estimate the number of Discordians because they are not required to hold Discordianism as their only belief system,[3] and because, by nature of the system itself, there is an encouragement to form schisms and cabals.[4][5]


Founding and structure

The foundational document of Discordianism is the _Principia Discordia_, fourth edition, written by Malaclypse the Younger, an alias of Greg Hill. The _Principia Discordia_ often hints that Discordianism was founded as a dialectic antithesis to more popular religions based on order, although the rhetoric throughout the book describes chaos as a much more underlying impulse of the universe. This may have been done with the intention of merely "balancing out" the creative forces of order and disorder, but the focus is on the more disorderly aspects of the world – at times the forces of order are even vilified.[6][7]

Popes

According to the _Principia Discordia_, "every single man, woman, and child on this Earth" is deemed a pope.[8]

Included in the _Principia Discordia_ is an official pope card that may be reproduced and distributed freely to anyone and everyone.[9] Papacy, however, is not granted through possession of this card; it merely informs people that they are "a genuine and authorized Pope" of Discordia.

Saints

There are also five classes of saints within Discordianism, who are those who best act as exemplars and are closer to perfection.[10] Only the first of these classes "Saint Second Class" contains real human beings (deceased and alive), with higher classes reserved for fictional beings who, by dint of being fictional, are better able to reach the Discordian view of perfection.[11]

A well-known example of a second-class saint is Emperor Norton, a citizen in 19th century San Francisco, who despite suffering delusions was beloved by much of the city. He is honoured as a saint within Discordianism for living his life according to truth as he saw it and a disregard for reality as others would perceive it.[12]


Mythology

Eris and Aneris

In discordian mythology, ANERIS is described as the sister of Eris a.k.a. Discordia. Whereas Eris/Discordia is the goddess of disorder and being, Aneris/Harmonia is the goddess of order and non-being.

"DOGMA III – HISTORY 32, 'COSMOGONY' " in _Principia Discordia_, states:

    In the beginning there was VOID, who had two daughters; one (the smaller) was that of BEING, named ERIS, and one (the larger) was of NON-BEING, named ANERIS.[13]

The sterile Aneris becomes jealous of Eris (who was born pregnant), and starts making existent things non-existent. This explains why life begins, and later ends in death.

    _And to this day, things appear and disappear in this very manner._[14]

The names of Eris and Aneris (who are later given a brother, _Spirituality_), are used to show some fundamental Discordian principles in "Psycho-Metaphysics":

    The Aneristic Principle is that of APPARENT ORDER; the Eristic Principle is that of APPARENT DISORDER. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of PURE CHAOS, which is a level deeper than is the level of distinction making.[15]

Hand of Eris

The hand of Eris (shown at right) and other proposed symbols are used informally in certain circles; however, it is unlikely that Eris, the trans-Neptunian dwarf planet, will be assigned an official symbol by the IAU, since graphical symbols are rarely assigned to minor objects in modern times.[16] A request to the Unicode Consortium to add the hand as a unicode symbol to represent the planet, along with a symbol for 90377 Sedna, was filed in 2016.[17]

The "original snub"

Apple_of_Discord.png]] The "original snub" is the Discordian name for the events preceding the judgement of Paris, although more focus is put on the actions of Eris. Zeus believes that Eris is a troublemaker, so he does not invite her to Peleus and Thetis's wedding. Having been snubbed, Eris creates a golden apple with the word _kallisti_ (, to the prettiest one) inscribed in it. This, the Apple of Discord, is a notable symbol in Discordianism for its inclusion in the Holy Chao, and is traditionally described as being made of gold (although whether that gold was metallic or Acapulco is noted as uncertain[18]).[19]

Some recent interpretations of the original snub place Eris as being not at all mischievous with her delivery of the apple, but instead suggest that Eris was simply bringing the apple as a wedding present for Thetis. This interpretation would see Eris as innocent and her causing of chaos as a by-product of the other wedding guests' reaction upon seeing her at the wedding.[20][21]


Philosophy

Three core principles

The _Principia Discordia_ holds three core principles: the Aneristic and Eristic principles representing order and disorder, and the notion that both are mere illusions. The following excerpt summarizes these principles:

Operation Mindfuck

Operation Mindfuck is an important practice in the Discordian religion. The concept was developed by Kerry Thornley and Robert Anton Wilson in 1968[22] and given its name by Wilson and Robert Shea in _The Illuminatus! Trilogy_.[23]


Writings

Discordian works include a number of books, not all of which actually exist. Among those that have been published are _Principia Discordia_, first published in 1965 (which includes portions of _The Honest Book of Truth_); and _The Illuminatus! Trilogy_, which had its first volume published in 1975.[24]

The _Principia Discordia_ is a Discordian religious text written by Greg Hill (Malaclypse the Younger) with Kerry Wendell Thornley (Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst).The phrase _Principia Discordia_, reminiscent of Newton's _Principia Mathematica_, is presumably intended to mean _Discordant Principles_, or _Principles of Discordance_.[25]

_Summa Universalia_ was another work by Malaclypse the Younger, purported to be a summary of the universe. It was excerpted in the first edition of _Principia_ but never published. It was mentioned in an introduction to one of the _Principia_ editions, and the work was quoted from in the first edition.[26][27]

_Zenarchy_ was first self-published by Thornley, under the pen name Ho Chi Zen, as a series of one-page (or _broadsheet_) newsletters in the 1960s.[28] A selection of the material was later reedited and expanded by Thornley and republished in paperback by IllumiNet Press in 1991. The book describes Thornley's concept of Zenarchy "a way of Zen applied to social life. A non-combative, non-participatory, no-politics approach to anarchy intended to get the serious student thinking."[29]

One of the most influential of all Discordian works, _the Illuminatus! Trilogy_ is a series of three novels written by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson purportedly between 1969 and 1971.[30] In a 1980 interview given to the science fiction magazine _Starship_, Wilson suggested the novel was an attempt to build a myth around Discordianism.

_Zen Without Zen Masters_ is a book by Camden Benares (The Count of Five), published in 1977, of koans, stories and exercises of a Discordian nature. It includes tales of several early Discordians including Hill (as Mal) and Thornley (as Omar and Ho Chi Zen). "Enlightenment of a Seeker" from this book is also present in _Principia Discordia_ as "A Zen Story".[31]

_Principia Discordia_ editions

The first edition was printed using Jim Garrison's Xerox printer in 1963.[32] The second edition was published under the title _Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost_ in a limited edition of five copies in 1965. Poee_symbol.jpg Sacred_Chao_2.jpg The _Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost_ was first published in a limited edition of five copies and released into the public domain in 1965.[33]

In 1978, a copy of a work from Kerry Thornley titled _THE PRINCIPIA Discordia or HOW THE WEST WAS LOST_ was placed in the HSCA JFK collections as document 010857.[34] Adam Gorightly, author of _The Prankster and the Conspiracy_ about Kerry Thornley and the early Discordians, said the copy in the JFK collection was not a copy of the first edition but a later and altered version containing some of the original material. In an interview with researcher Brenton Clutterbuck,[35] Gorightly said he had been given Greg Hill's copy of the first edition. This appeared in its entirety in _Historia Discordia_, a book on Discordian history released in spring of 2014.[36][37]

Related works

_The Black Iron Prison_

_The Black Iron Prison_ was an effort to create an updated, modern book that would function as _Principia Discordia_ did when released. The collaborators stated that "while the original _Principia Discordia_ holds important messages and philosophies, we wondered if some of the humor and language might be dated and lost on a younger generation of Discordians. We wanted to crystalize some of our favorite themes from the _Principia_, those of radical free will and self-emancipation." The goal was to encourage "critical thinking and self awareness" in the reader.[38]

_Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia: The Tales of Shamlicht_

_Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia: The Tales of Shamlicht_ by Reverend Loveshade with "foreplay" or foreword by S. John Ross was published in 2012 by Anaphora Literary Press.[39] The controversial book reportedly was inspired by an investigation by the FBI with portions of the book having been previously seized. _Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia_ includes blurbs (short reviews of the book) by R. Crumb, Sondra London, Alan Moore, Rev. Ivan Stang, Robert Anton Wilson (who saw an early draft), and others.[40][41] It was listed in January 2013 in both the print and online version of the _New York Review of Books_.[42] The book was soon pulled from publication after allegations of plagiarism were made on amazon.com and sent to the publisher. An editor denied the claims which did not specify what material was allegedly plagiarized.[43][44] The publisher stated, "In part, I took the book out of print because I was receiving harassing phone calls and emails with threat of harm via "discordian" jakes, and my phone was infected with a virus with a Discordian flavor."[45]

_Historia Discordia_

_Historia Discordia_ was compiled by Adam Gorightly with foreword by Robert Anton Wilson.[46] It is a compilation of early Discordian photos, tracts, art collages, and more including works by Discordianism founders Greg Hill (Malaclypse the Younger) and Kerry Thornley (Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst).[47] Among other things, it contains the long-missing _The Honest Book of Truth_ and the first edition of _Principia Discordia_.[48] It features a blurb by famed comic book writer Alan Moore.[49]

[25] In Latin, _discordia_ is not an adjective. It can be a singular noun by itself, meaning "discord", or, like _principia_, be the plural of a noun – _discordium_, also meaning "discord". In either case, the phrase consists of two juxtaposed nouns without a grammatical relationship.
