LIM CHIEW PENG was a Singaporean former national goalkeeper. Lim, a highly talented and acrobatic goalkeeper, died of cancer, aged 65, on November 27, 2016.[1]

"I think he was one of the best goalkeepers Singapore has produced. His talent was god-given. He was a natural. He was spectacular with high-flying saves," said ex-Lion Quah Kim Lye.

The left-footed goalkeeper became famous not only for his spectacular high-flying saves but also his "super drop kick". Former Singapore skipper Nazri Nasir said, "He was just spectacular, if not superlative. His super drop kick, with the left foot, was just extraordinary and so very accurate."[2]


Career

Lim had played in two Malaysia Cup finals in 1976 and 1979 and was part of the team when Singapore won the historic Malaysia Cup in 1977 after 12 years.[3]

He retired on February 12, 1980 after being in the national squad for 10 years.[4]

After his playing days, Lim took to goalkeeper coaching and was with five-time S.League champion Tampines Rovers FC.
