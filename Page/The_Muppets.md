THE MUPPETS are an ensemble cast of puppet characters known for their absurdist, burlesque, and self-referential style of variety-sketch comedy. Created by Jim and Jane Henson in 1955, they are the namesake for the Disney media franchise that encompasses television, music, film, and other media associated with the characters.

The Muppets originated in the short-form television series _Sam and Friends_, which aired from 1955 to 1961. Following appearances on late night talk shows and in advertising during the 1960s, the Muppets began appearing on _Sesame Street_ in 1969. The Muppets attained celebrity status and international recognition through _The Muppet Show_ (1976–1981), which garnered four Primetime Emmy Award wins and twenty-one nominations during its five-year run.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the Muppets diversified into theatrical feature films, including _The Muppet Movie_ (1979); _The Great Muppet Caper_ (1981); and _The Muppets Take Manhattan_ (1984). The Walt Disney Company began involvement with the Muppets in the late 1980s, during which Henson entered negotiations to sell The Jim Henson Company. The Muppets continued their media presence in the 1990s with television series _The Jim Henson Hour_ (1989) and _Muppets Tonight_ (1996–98), both of which were similar in format to _The Muppet Show_, and three films: _The Muppet Christmas Carol_ (1992), _Muppet Treasure Island_ (1996), and _Muppets from Space_ (1999).

Disney acquired the Muppets in February 2004, allowing the characters to gain broader public exposure than in previous years.[1][2][3] Under Disney, subsequent projects included two films: _The Muppets_ (2011) and _Muppets Most Wanted_ (2014); a short-lived primetime series on ABC[4][5][6][7][8]; and a reboot of the _Muppet Babies_ animated series.

Throughout their six-decade career, the Muppets have been regarded as a staple of the entertainment industry and popular culture in the United States and the English-speaking area generally, receiving recognition from various cultural institutions and organizations, including the American Film Institute, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Library of Congress, and the Hollywood Walk of Fame.


History

1950s–1960s: Beginnings

Jim_Henson_(1989).jpg The Muppets were created by puppeteer Jim Henson in the 1950s; among his earliest creations was Kermit the Frog, who would become Henson's most recognizable character. Originally conceived for an adult audience,[9] Henson claimed, and later recanted, that he coined the term "Muppet" as a portmanteau of the words "marionette" and "puppet".[10] In 1955, the Muppets were introduced in _Sam and Friends_, a short-form television series produced for WRC-TV in Washington D.C.[11] Developed by Henson and his future wife Jane Nebel, the series was the first form of puppet media not to incorporate a physical proscenium arch typical of such works, relying instead on the natural framing of the television set through which it was viewed.[12]

During the 1960s, the characters—in particular, Kermit and Rowlf the Dog—appeared in skits on several late-night talk shows and on television commercials, including _The Ed Sullivan Show._ Rowlf became the first Muppet character to appear regularly on network television when he began appearing with Jimmy Dean on _The Jimmy Dean Show_. In 1966, Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett began developing a children's educational television program and approached Henson to design a cast of Muppet characters during this stage. Produced by the Children's Television Workshop, the program debuted as _Sesame Street_ in 1969.

Henson and his creative team became closely involved with _Sesame Street_ during the years that followed; Henson waived his performance fee in exchange for retaining ownership rights to the Muppet characters created for the program. _Sesame Street_ garnered a positive response, and the Muppets' involvement in the series was said to be a vital component of its increasing popularity, providing an "effective and pleasurable viewing" method of presentation for its educational curriculum.[13][14]

1970s: _The Muppet Show_ and first film

In the early 1970s, the Muppets continued their presence in television, primarily appearing in _The Land of Gorch_ segments during the first season of _Saturday Night Live_. As his involvement with _Sesame Street_ continued, Henson mused about the possibility of creating a network television series featuring the Muppets;[15] as opposed to _Sesame Street_, however, this proposed series would be aimed at a more adult audience and focus largely on sketch comedy. Two pilot specials, _The Muppets Valentine Show_ and _The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence_, aired on ABC in 1974 and 1975, respectively.

After ABC passed on the pilots and no other major American network expressed interest in backing the project, British producer Lew Grade approached Henson and agreed to co-produce the series for Associated Television. Debuting in 1976, _The Muppet Show_ introduced new characters such as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, and Animal alongside existing characters such as Kermit and Rowlf. Aired in first-run syndication in the United States, _The Muppet Show_ became increasingly popular due to its sketch-variety format, unique form of humor, and prolific roster of guest stars. It was nominated for twenty-one Primetime Emmy Awards during its run, winning four, including Outstanding Variety Series in 1978. The success of _The Muppet Show_ allowed Henson Associates to diversify into theatrical films centered on the Muppets, the first of which, _The Muppet Movie_, was released in 1979.

1980s–1990s: Continued success

Following _The Muppet Movie_ were _The Great Muppet Caper_ and _The Muppets Take Manhattan_, released in 1981 and 1984, respectively. Collectively, the three films received four Academy Award nominations. In 1983, Henson debuted _Fraggle Rock_, which aired on HBO in the United States until 1987.[16]

In the late 1980s, Henson entered discussions with Michael Eisner and The Walt Disney Company, in which the latter would acquire Jim Henson Productions and, in turn, the Muppets. Disney expressed interest in purchasing the company for $150 million.[17] In addition, Eisner expressed a desire to include the _Sesame Street_ Muppet characters as part of the acquisition. Henson declined the proposal, however, considering it a "non-starter" for the deal.[18] As discussions between the two companies continued, Henson and Walt Disney Imagineering preemptively began developing Muppet-themed attractions for the Disney-MGM Studios at Walt Disney World.

However, the proposed merger was canceled after Henson's death in 1990. Nevertheless, Disney initiated a licensing agreement with Henson to use the characters in their theme parks.[19] The following year, Muppet*Vision 3D debuted at Disney-MGM Studios, the only attraction to be successfully developed from the original Imagineering plans. Retaining interest in the franchise, Disney co-produced the fourth and fifth Muppets films, _The Muppet Christmas Carol_ and _Muppet Treasure Island_, with Henson in 1992 and 1996, respectively.[20] The characters subsequently starred in _Muppets Tonight_, which aired from 1996 to 1998; and a sixth film, _Muppets from Space_, released by Columbia Pictures in 1999.

In 2000, Henson was sold to EM.TV & Merchandising AG for $680 million.[21] However, EM.TV was plagued with financial problems and the Henson family re-acquired the company in 2003, with the exception of the _Sesame Street_ characters, which were in the interim sold to Sesame Workshop.[22]

2000s: Disney acquisition

Fourteen years after initial negotiations began, Disney acquired the Muppets intellectual property from Henson for $75 million on February 17, 2004. The acquisition consisted of most of the Muppets film and television library, as well as the _Bear in the Big Blue House_ television series.[23][24][25][26] Exceptions included the _Sesame Street_ characters, which were previously sold to Sesame Workshop;[27] the _Fraggle Rock_ characters, which were retained by Henson; and the distribution rights to four films: _The Muppets Take Manhattan_, _Muppets from Space_, and _Kermit's Swamp Years,_ which were retained by Sony Pictures Entertainment; and _It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie_, retained by NBCUniversal Television Distribution.[28] Following the acquisition, Disney formed The Muppets Studio (originally The Muppets Holding Company), a wholly owned subsidiary responsible for managing the characters and franchise. As a result, the term "Muppet" became a legal trademark of Disney; under license from Disney, Sesame Workshop continues to use the term for their characters, as well archival footage of Kermit the Frog.

Henson retains the rights to several productions featuring the Disney-owned Muppet characters, including _Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas_; _The Christmas Toy_; _Sesame Street: 20 and Still Counting_; _Henson's Place_; _Billy Bunny's Animal Songs_; the original _Dog City_ special; and _Donna's Day_. While some of these have since been released uncut, most current releases of _Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas_ and _The Christmas Toy_ omit the appearances by Kermit the Frog.

Disney began gradually reintroducing the franchise to the mainstream in 2008.[29][30] As a method of regaining a wider audience, Disney began to produce and release a series of comedy shorts on YouTube. After the Muppets' "Bohemian Rhapsody" cover version was uploaded, it ultimately amassed 50 million views and won two Webby Awards.[31] In 2010, the Muppets starred in _The Muppets Kitchen with Cat Cora_, which co-starred Cat Cora and showcased cooking demonstrations.[32] A television special, _A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa_, premiered on NBC on December 17, 2008; and was released on DVD on September 29, 2009.[33]

In 2010, Disney used the Muppets to promote their volunteerism program at the company's theme parks. A Halloween special featuring the Muppets was developed during that time and expected to air on ABC that October, but was canceled.[34]

2010s: Resurgence

In 2011, the Muppets were featured in an eponymous seventh film, intended to serve as a "creative reboot" for the characters.[35] Disney had been furthering development on a Muppets film since 2008, when it considered adapting an unused screenplay by Jerry Juhl. Directed by James Bobin; written by Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller; and starring Segel, Amy Adams, Chris Cooper, and Rashida Jones, the film was a critical and commercial success, and won an Academy Award for Best Original Song.[36] During the film's publicity campaign, the Muppets appeared in promotional advertisements and in effusive marketing efforts by Disney and were also featured in a promotional video for Google+.[37] In March 2012, the Muppets received a collective star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[38] That year, the Muppets hosted a _Just for Laughs_ comedy gala in Montreal.[39]

Following the successful performance of _The Muppets_, Disney announced an eighth film in 2012, with Bobin and Stoller returning to direct and write, respectively.[40] _Muppets Most Wanted_ was released in 2014, and starred Ricky Gervais; Tina Fey; and Ty Burrell.[41][42]

Disney Theatrical Productions announced in 2013 that a live show based on the Muppets was in active development and that a 15-minute show had been conducted by Thomas Schumacher to see how the technical components would work.[43] _Muppet Moments_, an interstitial television series, premiered on Disney Junior in April 2015. The short-form series features conversations between the Muppets and young children.[44]

After the release of _Muppets Most Wanted_, Disney was interested in expanding the Muppets' presence across various media platforms, particularly in television.[45] Discussions for a new primetime series began internally within The Muppets Studio.[46] By April 2015, Bill Prady was commissioned to write a script for a pilot with the working title _Muppets 2015_.[47] In May 2015, ABC commissioned an eponymous mockumentary series, co-developed by Prady and Bob Kushell and directed by Randall Einhorn.[48][49] _The Muppets_ premiered on September 22, 2015 in the United States, and ended on March 1, 2016.[50][51] In September 2017, the Muppets performed a series of live shows at the Hollywood Bowl, hosted by Bobby Moynihan.[52] _Muppets Live Another Day_, a web television series starring Josh Gad, was announced in February 2018 and entered active development the following year, tentatively scheduled to debut on Disney+ [53][54] in 2020. In July 2018, the cast performed a series of live shows at London's O2 Arena, their first outside of the United States.[55]


Characters

KermitBeinGreen.jpg is Henson's most famous Muppet creation.]] The principal characters of _The Muppet Show_ and subsequent media include Kermit the Frog; Miss Piggy; Fozzie Bear; Gonzo; Rowlf the Dog; Scooter; Rizzo the Rat; Pepe the King Prawn; Dr. Bunsen Honeydew; Beaker; Statler and Waldorf; the Swedish Chef; Sam Eagle; Walter; and the Electric Mayhem, consisting of Dr. Teeth on keyboard, Animal on drums, Floyd Pepper on bass, Janice on lead guitar, Zoot on saxophone, and occasionally Lips on trumpet.

As well as _The Muppet Show_, the characters are popular for their appearances on _Sesame Street_ and _Fraggle Rock_; and also feature in _The Jimmy Dean Show_, _The Jim Henson Hour_, _Muppets Tonight_, _Bear in the Big Blue House_, _Franklin and Waldorf: From the Balcony_, and _The Muppets_. An adult-oriented Muppet segment, _The Land of Gorch_, was a regular feature in the first season of _Saturday Night Live_. Guest stars on _Saturday Night Live_ occasionally include both the Muppets and _Sesame Street_ characters, as well as Muppet likenesses of real people; these likenesses appear recurrently in early episodes of _The Muppet Show_ and on _Sesame Street_, and appear occasionally on other series such as _30 Rock_.

Following Disney's acquisition of the Muppets, puppets created by The Jim Henson Company are no longer referred to as Muppets. Puppets created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, including those in _Labyrinth_ and _The Dark Crystal_, have never been considered Muppets,[56] as they are generally more complex in design and performance than regular Muppets. At Henson's suggestion, the _Star Wars_ character Yoda was originally performed by Frank Oz,[57] and has been loosely described as a Muppet in media and reference works; he is not, however, and Henson otherwise had no involvement in the character's conception.[58][59]

At the start of the Muppets' formation, Jim and Jane Henson were the group's only performers. In 1961, Jane retired to focus on raising their children. Seeking additional performers, Jim came into contact with Frank Oz that year. Although interested, Oz initially declined due to his youth and commitment to high school, and instead suggested Jerry Juhl, who worked alongside Oz at the Vagabond Puppet Theater in Oakland, California. Upon graduating, Oz subsequently joined in August 1963. By the time _The Muppet Show_ began, the primary cast of performers grew to consist of Henson; Oz; Dave Goelz; Jerry Nelson; Richard Hunt; and later, Steve Whitmire, while Juhl became head writer for the series. From _The Muppet Show_ onward, Kevin Clash; Kathryn Mullen; Louise Gold; Karen Prell; Fran Brill, Caroll Spinney; and Brian Henson performed several minor characters and often assisted the main performers with puppeteering. Many of these puppeteers performed characters across _The Muppet Show,_ _Sesame Street_, _Fraggle Rock_, and other Henson-related projects.

Henson, Hunt, and Nelson continued performing until their deaths in 1990, 1992, and 2012, respectively. Whitmire, Goelz, and Bill Barretta, who joined the main cast of performers in the mid-1990s, assumed Henson's characters, with Whitmire also assuming the role of Beaker. The remainder of Hunt's characters were left without a stable performer until David Rudman began performing those characters in the late 2000s. Oz continued performing until his retirement from puppeteering in 2000; Eric Jacobson assumed his characters beginning in 2002.[60] At Nelson's behest, Matt Vogel gradually began performing his characters in 2008.

Whitmire was dismissed from the cast in 2016, with Vogel cast as Kermit the Frog in 2017, and the majority of Whitmire's characters assumed by the remainder of the cast.[61] The Muppets are currently performed by a cast of six principal puppeteers: Jacobson, Goelz, Barretta, Rudman, Vogel and Peter Linz.[62]


Design and performance

Rowlf_the_Dog_in_Jim_Henson's_Fantastic_World_Touring_exhibit_(in_Little_Rock,_Arkansas).jpg's design features the distinct wide mouth and glove-like hands found in typical Muppets. ]]

The majority of the Muppets are designed as hand puppets, with several characters utilizing rods. Common design elements of the Muppets include wide mouths and large protruding eyes. The puppets are often molded or carved out of various types of foam and covered with any felt-like material. Muppet characters may represent humans; anthropomorphic characters; realistic animals; robots; extraterrestrial or mythical creatures; or any other forms of abstract characters.

The Muppets are distinguished from ventriloquist dummies, which are often animated only in the head and face, in that their arms or other features are also animated. They are also generally made of softer material. They are presented as being independent of the puppeteer, who is usually not visible—hidden behind a set or outside of the camera frame. Using the camera frame to this advantage was an innovation of the Muppets. Prior to this, there would often be a stage masking the performers, as if in a live presentation. Sometimes, they are seen full-bodied; this is achieved by using invisible strings to manipulate the characters, with vocals added at a later point.[63]

Since 2006, Disney has contracted Puppet Heap to produce and maintain newer models of the Muppets.[64] The puppeteer, referred to as the "Muppet performer", holds the character above their head or in front of their body, with one hand operating the head and mouth and the other manipulating the hands and arms, either with two separate control rods or – in the case of "live-hand" Muppets – wearing the hands similarly to gloves. One consequence of this design is that most Muppets are left-handed, with the performer using their right hand to operate the head while operating the arm with their left hand.

In the case of more complex Muppets, several puppeteers may control a single character; the performer who controls the mouth usually provides the voice for the character. As technology has advanced, the Jim Henson team and other puppeteers have developed several means to operate the Muppets for film and television; these include the use of suspended rigs, internal motors, remote manipulators, and computer enhanced and superimposed images. Creative use of different technologies has allowed for scenes in which the Muppets appear to perform such complex movements as riding bicycles, rowing boats, and dancing wholly independently of the performer.

According to writer Michael Davis, the characters tend to develop "organically", alluding to the performers taking up to a year to develop their characters and voices. The characters are also "test-driven, passed around from one Henson troupe member to another in the hope of finding the perfect human-Muppet match".[65] When interacting with them, children tended to believe that the Muppets were living creatures, even in the presence of the puppeteers.[66]

Theme parks

Muppet*Vision_3D_Entrance_(23471898675).jpg attraction has operated at Disney's Hollywood Studios since 1991.]] Muppets_(23177015300).jpg The Muppets appear at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, having first made appearances at Walt Disney World in 1990. Their first featured attraction, _Here Comes the Muppets_, was a live stage show that opened shortly after Jim Henson's death and ran at Disney's Hollywood Studios (known then as Disney-MGM Studios) for a year.[67] Muppet*Vision 3D, a 4D film attraction that uses audio-animatronic Muppets and 4D effects, then opened at Disney's Hollywood Studios on May 16, 1991. The attraction is notable for being the final Muppets project to be produced by Jim Henson. Muppet*Vision 3D had a subsequent opening at Disney California Adventure, on February 8, 2001, and operated there until its closure in 2014.

In addition to their main presence at Disney's Hollywood Studios, the Muppets also appear in _Great Moments in American History_, a live show at the Magic Kingdom and the Muppet Mobile Lab at Epcot.[68][69] The latter attraction is a free-roving vehicle with audio-animatronics of Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker. As part of Disney's Living Character Initiative, it premiered in 2007 at Epcot[70] and was later previewed at Disney California Adventure and Hong Kong Disneyland.[71][72]

In 2010, the Muppets were the face of the "Give a Day, Get a Disney Day" charity campaign. Guests could register for a select service activity on the Disney website, and in return for completing the service work, participants could print a voucher for a free one-day admission ticket to Disneyland or Walt Disney World Resort. The Muppets appeared in television and print ads for the campaign and were featured prominently on the campaign's website.[73]

Disney has released numerous collector pins featuring the Muppets since 2004. These include Limited Edition pins, Hidden Mickey pin collections, mystery pin sets, 2008 pin sets promoting _The Muppets_, cast lanyard pins, and assorted individual rack pins. Over 100 pins displaying the characters have been released overall.[74]

Publishing

Since the late 1970s, numerous Muppet-related comic books have been released over the years. The first comic strips based on the Muppets appeared on September 21, 1981, in over 500 daily newspapers, just months after _The Muppet Show_ ended its five-year run. _The Muppets Comic Strip_ was printed daily from 1981 to 1986. By the end of its initial run, the comic strip was seen in over 660 newspapers worldwide. Special strips were also created in color, exclusively for issues of _Muppet Magazine_.

The only film in the franchise to see a comic book adaptation was _The Muppets Take Manhattan_. The comic book series was adapted by Marvel Comics in 1984, as the 68-page story in _Marvel Super Special_ No. 32, August. The adaptation was later re-printed into three limited series issues, released under Marvel's Star Comics imprint (November 1984 – January 1985).

In the wake of the success of the _Muppet Babies_ television show, Star Comics began releasing the _Muppet Babies_ comic book title on a bi-monthly basis. These were original stories, not adaptations of the show's episodes. In the final _Disney Adventures_ issue, with a cover date of November 2007, a one-page story single strip focusing on Fozzie Bear, Smedley, Statler, and Waldorf (with a cameo by Scooter) was released. Roger Langridge wrote and drew the comics intending it to be more long running.

In 2009, Boom! Studios began publishing _The Muppet Show_, a mini-series based on the eponymous television show and written and drawn by Roger Langridge. An ongoing series titled _The Muppet Show: The Comic Book_ followed and ran for eleven issues. Additionally, Boom! Studios also published Muppet fairy-tale comic adaptations similar to _The Muppet Christmas Carol_ and _Muppet Treasure Island_. In 2012, Marvel Comics took over the publishing duties for the series.[75]

A comic strip by Guy Gilchrist and Brad Gilchrist circulated in newspapers during the 1980s. Many of the strips were compiled in various book collections.[76]

_Muppet Magazine_ was published from 1983 to 1989. The magazine took on the format of being by the Muppets more than about them and had such features as celebrity interviews and comic stories.[77]


In popular culture

CeeLo_Green_performing_with_the_Muppets_at_the_Rockefeller_Center_Christmas_Tree_Lighting_2012_(11200418446).jpg at Rockefeller Center in 2012.]] The popularity of the Muppets has been so pervasive that the characters have been viewed by the media as celebrities in their own right.[78] The Muppets have received their own collective star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, with Kermit having his own individual star as well.[79] The characters have also presented at the Academy Awards and Emmy Awards;[80][81] made cameo appearances in such feature films as _Rocky III_,[82] _An American Werewolf in London_[83] and _Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium_;[84] and have been interviewed on the news magazine _60 Minutes_.

Kermit was interviewed early on in Jon Stewart's run on _The Daily Show_,[85] guest hosted _The Tonight Show_, _Jimmy Kimmel Live!_, _Extreme Makeover: Home Edition_, _America's Funniest Home Videos_ and an April Fools' Day edition of _Larry King Live_;[86] and has served as Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade.[87] The characters also appeared in-character on such sitcoms and dramas as _The Cosby Show_ and _The Torkelsons_.[88] The music video for the Weezer song "Keep Fishin'" is premised on the band performing on _The Muppet Show_ and features appearances by several characters.

On September 28, 2005, the United States Postal Service released a _Jim Henson and the Muppets_ postage stamp series.[89] The Muppets also appeared on _Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve_ for the 2008 countdown on December 31, 2007. Kermit, Rizzo, and others welcomed in the new year with a series of messages to welcome viewers back from the advertising breaks. After one such segment, with Kermit in Times Square, co-host Ryan Seacrest thanked his pal "Kerms" for the help bringing in '08.[90] Miss Piggy has appeared as a guest on _The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson_ and Kermit appeared on _Hollywood Squares_ and as one of the celebrity commentators on VH1's _I Love_ documentary series. Kermit and the Muppets (and also Bear from _Bear in the Big Blue House_) have also made many appearances on _The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon_.

On July 25, 2007, the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta announced the opening of a new Jim Henson Wing, which would house anywhere from 500 to 700 retired Muppets. The new wing, first set to open in 2012 with films, sketches, and other materials from the Jim Henson Company archives, eventually opened as a gallery within the _Worlds of Puppetry_ exhibition at the Center in November 2015.[91][92][93]

Muppet-like and Muppet-inspired puppets star in the 2004 Tony Award-winning Broadway musical _Avenue Q_. Peter Jackson's film, _Meet the Feebles_ is another parody of the Muppets. A vomit-spewing Kermit the Frog was a recurring character on _Late Night with Conan O'Brien_, and the Muppets were frequently preempted at the beginning of episodes for the Canadian series _You Can't Do That on Television._ Seth Green's short-lived show _Greg the Bunny_ was about sentient hand-puppets working in a Muppet-like children's show. Many other films and television shows such as _The Simpsons_, _Family Guy_, _The West Wing_ and _Robot Chicken_ have referenced The Muppets.
