WILLIAM MOYLAN was born in Ireland on June 22, 1822.[1] He emigrated to the United States early in his life, and before joining the Society of Jesuits was committed to volunteer work.[2] Moylan, as a secular priest, worked with the Native Americans and fishermen on the Gasp√© Peninsula. When he was twenty-nine, on November 14, 1851 he joined the Society of Jesuits.[3] After joining the Society, he was assigned to teach a course at Fordham University. After several other positions, including at St. Francis Xavier's, Moylan became the ninth president of Fordham in 1865.


St. John's College--Fordham University

Moylan made several additions to the college that helped advance it into the late-nineteenth-century world. "Some examples of these changes include napkins on the tables (1867), hot buns for the boarder in the afternoon (1868)."[4] Alongside these changes, Moylan also decided to continue the goal of his predecessor, Edward Doucet; he wanted to expand Fordham's campus through the addition of a new building. He wrote a letter to the Department of Education in Albany describing the advantages of the new building for the taxpayers, began a novena, and raised the tuition.[5] While the tuition increase did provide Moylan with some of the funds he desired, Albany rejected his proposal. He modified his goal, and decided to start with the building of a new wing.


Legacy

The new wing, Seniors' Hall, was finished in 1867. It was "a five-story building located to the east of the Administration Building for the college students that eventually contained dormitories, classrooms, study halls, reading rooms, a billiard room, and a gym complete with battling-net for baseball practice during the winter."[6] While Moylan's dream for the college was not completed, the Seniors' Hall forms a part of the large Dealy building currently a part of the Rose Hill campus.
