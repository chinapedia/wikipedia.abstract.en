History

The library system described itself as a 25-year-old system in 2009. Gadsden County, however, has a long history of municipal and subscription public library service, dating back at least to the early 1900s.[4]

One predecessor of the current library system was the Quincy Library, listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, which was opened in 1931 in the former Quincy Academy by the Quincy Women's Library Club and which operated until at least 1973.[5]


Services

A library card is free to residents of Gadsden County, and to those employed there. Library privilege lasts four years, and it is free to renew it. Applicants must provide photo identification and proof of residency. A parent or guardian must sign a statement of responsibility for children 17 and under. If a library account is inactive for four years then it will be deleted from the system unless there are fines attached to the account. A lost library card can be replaced for a $1.00 fee.[6]

In addition to books, audiobooks, and DVDs, downloadable materials are available via services such as Axis 360, Tumblebooks, and Book Flix.[7] Free wifi is available in the libraries, as well as public access to computers, meeting rooms, and self-service copy machines. The library promotes programs and events for adults and for youth throughout the year, including computer classes. LVA-Gadsden, Inc., is housed by the library and offers basic tutoring, ESL, computer literacy,[8] and GED instruction.
