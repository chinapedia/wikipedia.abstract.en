YOUSSEF RAKHA (Arabic: يوسف رخا; born on 12 June 1976 in Cairo, Egypt) is an Egyptian writer. His work explores language and identity in the context of Cairo, and reflects connections with the Arab-Islamic canon and world literature. He has worked in many genres in both Arabic and English, and is known for his essays and poems as well as his novels.


Early life

The only child of a formerly Marxist lawyer, Elsaid Rakha, and an English-to-Arabic translator, Labiba Saad, Rakha was born and grew up in Dokki, on the western bank of the Nile, where he lives with his family today. At the age of 17 he left Egypt for the UK, where he obtained a first class honours BA in English and Philosophy from Hull University in 1998. On his return he joined the staff of _Al-Ahram Weekly_, the Cairo-based English-language newspaper, where he has worked regularly since 1999.

Rakha's biography is sketched out in, among other sources, the introduction to _Beirut39: New Writing from the Arab World_ edited by Samuel Shimon,[1] Starkey's chapter in _Studying Modern Arabic Literature_ (footnote 4), _Banipal_ online[2] and Pro Helvetia's Territory Crossings.[3]


Career

Novels

Rakha is best known for his first novel, _The_ _Book of the Sultan's Seal: Strange Incidents from History in the City of Mars._ First published in 2011 as _Kitab at-Tugra: Gharaib at-Tarikh fi Madinat al-Marrikh_ (Arabic: كتاب الطغرى: غرائب التاريخ في مدينة المريخ), the book is studied for its innovative use of Arabic, its postmodern take on the theme of the caliphate, its reimagining of the city of Cairo and its possible significance in the history of Arabic literature. It won the Banipal Seif Ghobash Prize for Paul Starkey’s English translation in 2015, and was published in French in 2016.

For academic interest in _The Book of the Sultan's Seal_, see Paul Starkey's chapter in _Studying Modern Arabic Literature_,[4] Benjamin Koerber's paper in the _Journal of Arabic Literature_,[5] and Anton Shammas's remark on the English publisher's website.[6] For the Banipal Prize, see the Banipal Trust site.[7] For the French translation, by Philippe Vigreux, see .[8]

Since 2011 Rakha has completed two other novels in a proposed trilogy on the January Revolution, _The Crocodiles_ (Arabic: التماسيح)[9] and _Paulo_ (Arabic: باولو). The latter was longlisted for the Arabic Booker in 2017 (the IPAF longlist for 2017[10]) and won the 2017 Sawiris Cultural Award for Best Novel in January 2018.[11]

Other Work

Rakha is also known as a photographer and the editor of a bilingual literature and photography site named after his first novel, The Sultan's Seal: Cairo's Coolest Cosmopolitan Hotel. His photography is featured on _Mada Masr_[12] _Berfrois_,[13] P1xels[14] and _Bidoun_.[15] His site has helped to introduce significant young writers in Arabic like the Libyan Ali Latife, the Algerian Salah Badis, the Palestinian Carol Sasnour and the Egyptian Mina Nagy; it has featured literary and photographic figures including Bezav Mahmod, Hilary Plum, Niall Griffiths and Pauls Toutonghi. A list of contributors can be found at yrakha.com.[16][17]

Prior to writing _The Book of the Sultan's Seal_, Rakha contributed to the coverage of Arab culture in English for many years as a reporter, literary critic and cultural editor. See the _Al-Ahram Weekly_ archives for Rakha's numerous pieces in the Culture and Profile sections especially.[18] He also wrote literary non-fiction and poetry in Arabic, for which he was chosen to participate in the Hay Festival Beirut39 event as one of the 39 best Arab writers under 40. His 2006 photo travelogue _Beirut Shi Mahal_ (Arabic: بيروت شي محل), later translated into Polish, was nominated for the Lettre Ulysses Award for the Art of Reportage. For the Polish translation of the Beirut travelogue see Dobra Literatura.[19]

As an English-language essayist and short fiction writer, Rakha has also contributed to numerous publications in the US and the UK.[20] Publications in which he has written include, among many others, _The Atlantic_,[21] _The New York Times_,[22] _The White Review_,[23] _Guernica_[24] and _The Kenyon Review_.[25]
