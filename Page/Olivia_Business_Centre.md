The first building completed, Olivia Gate, has an area of 18,000 m² and an underground garage for 420 cars [2]. Olivia Point (9,600 m²) came next, followed by Olivia Tower (14,200 m²).

With the next building – Olivia Six (ca. 17,000 m² of leasable area [3] – ref>launched in May ref>2015, the complex became Poland’s second largest office park [4]

In April 2015, the project entered the next stage: the construction of Olivia Star – the tallest building in Northern Poland, with the year-round winter garden for residents [5]. Olivia Star will be located between Olivia Four and Olivia Six, thereby closing the ring around the inner, publicly accessible patio with greenery and water features [6]. At this stage, the Olivia Business Centre’s leasable floor area will increase from 73,000 sq m to 120,000 sq m. The first tenants are expected to move in at the beginning of 2017 [7]

Olivia Business Centre is developed by Maciej Grabski – the co-founder of Wirtualna Polska (the first web portal in Poland). The buildings are constructed by Pekabex. The overall architectural concept of the complex was prepared by Konior and Partners Architects [8]. The design work is continued by BJK Architekci, an architectural firm based in Gdynia, responsible for the entirety of the Olivia Six and Olivia Star design [9]

The 3.5 hectare land site can accommodate up to 12 modern, environment-friendly office buildings.
