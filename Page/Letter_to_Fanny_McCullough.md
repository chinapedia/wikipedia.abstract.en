Fanny_McCullough_Orme.jpg Lt._Col._William_McCullough.jpg In December 1862, President of the United States Abraham Lincoln sent a brief consoling LETTER TO FANNY MCCULLOUGH, the daughter of lieutenant colonel William McCullough, following his death in the American Civil War.


Background

Lincoln had met William McCullough years before when Lincoln was a circuit lawyer in Illinois and McCullough was a Circuit Clerk in McLean County. Lincoln would sometimes stay with the McCullough family when he reached the Bloomington, Illinois area of the circuit. McCullough became an ardent supporter of Lincoln beginning with Lincoln's successful run for Congress in 1846. With the start of the Civil War, McCullough petitioned Lincoln to allow him enlist despite his health problems and age. McCullough's request was granted and he was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the 4th Illinois Cavalry.[1]

After McCullough was killed December 5, 1862 in an engagement near Coffeeville, Mississippi,[2] his daughter Mary Frances ("Fanny") was inconsolable and locked herself in her room. At the request of David Davis, a mutual friend of Lincoln and the McCullough family, Lincoln wrote to Fanny on December 23.[3]
