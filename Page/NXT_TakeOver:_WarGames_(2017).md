NXT TAKEOVER: WARGAMES[1] (originally NXT TAKEOVER: HOUSTON)[2] was a professional wrestling show and WWE Network event in the NXT TakeOver series that took place on November 18, 2017 at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas. The event was produced by WWE for its NXT brand and streamed live on the WWE Network. The event's name is derived from the match of the same name that was originally used in the National Wrestling Alliance and later, World Championship Wrestling.[3]

Five matches were contested at the event. In the main event, The Undisputed Era (Adam Cole, Bobby Fish, and Kyle O'Reilly) defeated Sanity (Alexander Wolfe, Eric Young, and Killian Dain) and the team of The Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar) and Roderick Strong in a WarGames match. On the undercard, Ember Moon defeated Kairi Sane, Nikki Cross, and Peyton Royce in a Fatal 4 -Way match to win the vacant NXT Women's Championship, and Andrade Cien Almas defeated Drew McIntyre to win the NXT Championship.

At the NXT TakeOver: Philadelphia preshow, the NXT TakeOver: WarGames won the category "NXT TakeOver of the Year" for the NXT Year-End Award.


Storylines

The card included five matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by WWE's writers.[4][5]. Storylines were produced on the _NXT_ television program. NXT TakeOver is a series of professional wrestling shows that began on May 29, 2014, as the WWE developmental league NXT held their second WWE Network exclusive live broadcast billed as NXT TakeOver.[6] In subsequent months, the "TakeOver" moniker became the brand used by WWE for all of their NXT live specials. NXT TakeOver: WarGames was the eighteenth overall show held under the NXT TakeOver banner, and the fifth to be held in 2017. Originally promoted as NXT TakeOver: Houston,[7] it was changed to WarGames after an announcement by Triple H on October 4, 2017. The event's name is derived from an old match type that was originally used in the National Wrestling Alliance, and later, an annual match held by World Championship Wrestling. NXT TakeOver: WarGames featured the namesake match, which was the first time in nearly twenty years since the match last occurred.[8]

On the September 6 episode of _NXT_, Asuka relinquished the NXT Women's Championship due to a legitimate injury she sustained at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III; she was subsequently moved up to the main roster on the Raw brand.[9][10] On September 12, Kairi Sane won the Mae Young Classic[11] and earned herself a shot at the vacant NXT Women's Championship at NXT TakeOver: WarGames.[12] On the September 27 episode of _NXT_, General Manager William Regal made the match at WarGames a fatal four-way for the vacant NXT Women's Championship, with qualifying matches held over the following weeks to determine the other three participants.[13] On the October 11 episode, Peyton Royce defeated Nikki Cross (of Sanity) and Liv Morgan to qualify for the match by pinning Cross after she was distracted by Taynara Conti, who was escorted by The Undisputed Era.[14] The following week, Ember Moon qualified by defeating Ruby Riot and Sonya Deville.[15] On the next episode, Nikki Cross last eliminated Billie Kay in a battle royal to qualify for the last spot in the fatal four-way.[16] Cross later defeated Taynara in a singles match on the November 1 episode.[17] The following week, Sane defeated Kay in singles competition.[18] The next week, after Moon defeated Mercedes Martinez, the other three competitors came to the ring and ringside area and stared each other down.[19]

At TakeOver: Brooklyn III, Drew McIntyre defeated Bobby Roode to win the NXT Championship;[20] Roode was then promoted to the main roster on the SmackDown brand.[21] On the October 4 episode of _NXT_, McIntyre successfully defended his title against Roderick Strong.[22] Two weeks later, Andrade Cien Almas's manager, Zelina Vega, interrupted McIntyre's interview, stating that Almas and McIntyre were the same, accusing him of avoiding Almas, and expressing Almas's interest in challenging him for the title.[23] On the October 25 episode of _NXT_, Vega said they had been waiting for a contract for an NXT Championship match with McIntyre, saying that McIntyre and Strong were weak compared to Almas. Almas then defeated Strong after Vega physically interfered in their match. Afterwards, Vega challenged McIntyre to meet Almas in the ring the next week.[24] After the show went off the air, General Manager William Regal, in a video posted to Twitter, announced that McIntyre versus Almas for the title has been made official and their confrontation next week will be a contract signing.[25] On the November 1 episode of _NXT_, McIntyre signed the contract to defend his title at WarGames and brought it out to the ring, where Almas attacked McIntyre and signed the contract as well.[26] McIntyre called Almas out on the November 14 episode, stating that Almas was taking orders from Vega and wondered if she would ever let him off his leash. Vega and Almas then came out and attacked McIntyre, standing tall with the title.[27]

At TakeOver: Brooklyn III, Sanity (Alexander Wolfe and Eric Young) defeated The Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar) to win the NXT Tag Team Championship. After the match, Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly attacked all four competitors.[28] Over the next several weeks, Adam Cole (who debuted at Brooklyn III by attacking newly crowned NXT Champion Drew McIntyre),[29] Fish, and O'Reilly, now calling themselves "The Undisputed Era", and Sanity (including Killian Dain) brawled with each other after their respective matches. On the September 27 episode of _NXT_, Cole defeated Young after Young was distracted with the faction brawl at ringside.[30] The next week, after McIntyre successfully defended his title against Roderick Strong, The Undisputed Era came out to urge Strong to join them.[31] On the October 18 episode, The Authors of Pain attacked Sanity during their match with Undisputed Era, holding up the tag titles and staring down Undisputed.[32] The following week, after Roderick Strong's match with Andrade Cien Almas, Undisputed Era came down to the ring to convince Strong to join them, telling him to "think it over."[33] On the November 1 episode, the Authors defeated Sanity by disqualification in their tag team championship rematch after they were attacked by The Undisputed Era, who beat up Sanity. Strong came out, teasing joining Undisputed, but attacked Cole instead, sending Undisputed running. General Manager William Regal then came out and announced that in order to restore order, the three teams would face off in the only match that could contain them, a WarGames match, the first such match since the September 4, 2000, episode of _WCW Monday Nitro_, at TakeOver: WarGames.[34] On the November 8 episode, Strong defeated Cole by disqualification after Fish and O'Reilly pulled him out of the ring. After the match, a brawl ensued between all three teams.[35]

On the September 6 episode of _NXT_, Aleister Black began a promo on his career so far, but was interrupted by Velveteen Dream, who called Black "afraid." Black then kicked the microphone out of Dream's hand.[36] On the October 4 episode, Black was scheduled to compete against the debuting Lio Rush, but the latter was attacked by Dream, who said he would make Black "say his name."[37] Dream then defeated Lio the following week, celebrating with Black's signature pose.[38] The following week, during Black's match with Raul Mendoza, Dream came to ringside and wore Black's jacket, eliciting a stare from Black.[39] On the October 25 episode, before Black's scheduled match, Dream attacked him. Then, Black ran him off and stared him down.[40] The following episode, a video was played showing Black challenging Dream to a match at TakeOver, stating he had his attention and in which it was made official.[41] The next week, on the November 8 episode, Dream defeated Cezar Bononi and accepted Black's challenge to a match at WarGames, promising that Black's lips would say his name.[42]

On the November 8 episode of _NXT_, Kassius Ohno requested a match against Lars Sullivan to prove he belongs in the NXT Championship picture, which Regal accepted and made it official.[43] The next week, after Sullivan defeated Raul Mendoza, Ohno stopped Sullivan from attacking Mendoza, staring each other down as Sullivan left the ring.[44]
