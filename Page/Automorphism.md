Automorphic}} In mathematics, an AUTOMORPHISM is an isomorphism from a mathematical object to itself. It is, in some sense, a symmetry of the object, and a way of mapping the object to itself while preserving all of its structure. The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a group, called the AUTOMORPHISM GROUP. It is, loosely speaking, the symmetry group of the object.


Definition

In the context of abstract algebra, a mathematical object is an algebraic structure such as a group, ring, or vector space. An AUTOMORPHISM is simply a bijective homomorphism of an object with itself. (The definition of a homomorphism depends on the type of algebraic structure; see, for example, group homomorphism, ring homomorphism, and linear operator).

The identity morphism (identity mapping) is called the TRIVIAL AUTOMORPHISM in some contexts. Respectively, other (non-identity) automorphisms are called NONTRIVIAL AUTOMORPHISMS.

The exact definition of an automorphism depends on the type of "mathematical object" in question and what, precisely, constitutes an "isomorphism" of that object. The most general setting in which these words have meaning is an abstract branch of mathematics called category theory. Category theory deals with abstract objects and morphisms between those objects.

In category theory, an AUTOMORPHISM is an endomorphism (i.e., a morphism from an object to itself) which is also an isomorphism (in the categorical sense of the word).

This is a very abstract definition since, in category theory, morphisms aren't necessarily functions and objects aren't necessarily sets. In most concrete settings, however, the objects will be sets with some additional structure and the morphisms will be functions preserving that structure.


Automorphism group

If the automorphisms of an object form a set (instead of a proper class), then they form a group under composition of morphisms. This group is called the AUTOMORPHISM GROUP of .

Closure: Composition of two automorphisms is another automorphism.
Associativity: It is part of the definition of a category that composition of morphisms is associative.
Identity: The identity is the identity morphism from an object to itself, which is an automorphism.
Inverses: By definition every isomorphism has an inverse which is also an isomorphism, and since the inverse is also an endomorphism of the same object it is an automorphism.

The automorphism group of an object _X_ in a category _C_ is denoted Aut_(_C_)(_X_), or simply Aut(_X_) if the category is clear from context.


Examples

-   In set theory, an arbitrary permutation of the elements of a set _X_ is an automorphism. The automorphism group of _X_ is also called the symmetric group on _X_.
-   In elementary arithmetic, the set of integers, Z, considered as a group under addition, has a unique nontrivial automorphism: negation. Considered as a ring, however, it has only the trivial automorphism. Generally speaking, negation is an automorphism of any abelian group, but not of a ring or field.
-   A group automorphism is a group isomorphism from a group to itself. Informally, it is a permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged. For every group _G_ there is a natural group homomorphism _G_ → Aut(_G_) whose image is the group Inn(_G_) of inner automorphisms and whose kernel is the center of _G_. Thus, if _G_ has trivial center it can be embedded into its own automorphism group.[1]
-   In linear algebra, an endomorphism of a vector space _V_ is a linear operator _V_ → _V_. An automorphism is an invertible linear operator on _V_. When the vector space is finite-dimensional, the automorphism group of _V_ is the same as the general linear group, GL(_V_).
-   A field automorphism is a bijective ring homomorphism from a field to itself. In the cases of the rational numbers (Q) and the real numbers (R) there are no nontrivial field automorphisms. Some subfields of R have nontrivial field automorphisms, which however do not extend to all of R (because they cannot preserve the property of a number having a square root in R). In the case of the complex numbers, C, there is a unique nontrivial automorphism that sends R into R: complex conjugation, but there are infinitely (uncountably) many "wild" automorphisms (assuming the axiom of choice).[2][3] Field automorphisms are important to the theory of field extensions, in particular Galois extensions. In the case of a Galois extension _L_/_K_ the subgroup of all automorphisms of _L_ fixing _K_ pointwise is called the Galois group of the extension.
-   The automorphism group of the quaternions (H) as a ring are the inner automorphisms, by the Skolem–Noether theorem: maps of the form .. This group is isomorphic to SO(3), the group of rotations in 3-dimensional space.
-   The automorphism group of the octonions (O) is the exceptional Lie group G₂.
-   In graph theory an automorphism of a graph is a permutation of the nodes that preserves edges and non-edges. In particular, if two nodes are joined by an edge, so are their images under the permutation.
-   In geometry, an automorphism may be called a motion of the space. Specialized terminology is also used:
    -   In metric geometry an automorphism is a self-isometry. The automorphism group is also called the isometry group.
    -   In the category of Riemann surfaces, an automorphism is a biholomorphic map (also called a conformal map), from a surface to itself. For example, the automorphisms of the Riemann sphere are Möbius transformations.
    -   An automorphism of a differentiable manifold _M_ is a diffeomorphism from _M_ to itself. The automorphism group is sometimes denoted Diff(_M_).
    -   In topology, morphisms between topological spaces are called continuous maps, and an automorphism of a topological space is a homeomorphism of the space to itself, or self-homeomorphism (see homeomorphism group). In this example it is _not sufficient_ for a morphism to be bijective to be an isomorphism.


History

One of the earliest group automorphisms (automorphism of a group, not simply a group of automorphisms of points) was given by the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton in 1856, in his icosian calculus, where he discovered an order two automorphism,[4] writing:

  so that μ is a new fifth root of unity, connected with the former fifth root λ by relations of perfect reciprocity.


Inner and outer automorphisms

In some categories—notably groups, rings, and Lie algebras—it is possible to separate automorphisms into two types, called "inner" and "outer" automorphisms.

In the case of groups, the inner automorphisms are the conjugations by the elements of the group itself. For each element _a_ of a group _G_, conjugation by _a_ is the operation given by (or _a_^(−1)_ga_; usage varies). One can easily check that conjugation by _a_ is a group automorphism. The inner automorphisms form a normal subgroup of Aut(_G_), denoted by Inn(_G_); this is called Goursat's lemma.

The other automorphisms are called outer automorphisms. The quotient group is usually denoted by Out(_G_); the non-trivial elements are the cosets that contain the outer automorphisms.

The same definition holds in any unital ring or algebra where _a_ is any invertible element. For Lie algebras the definition is slightly different.
