BRAIN BAR is an annual event held in Budapest, Hungary. It has been referred to as "a sort of South By Southwest on the Danube" owing to its fusion of tech conference and music festival.[1] The event attracted more than 15,000 attendees in 2019 from every continent and a livestream audience of more than 50,000.[2][3]

Brain Bar focuses on the free exchange of ideas instead of one-way communication. Its audience is encouraged to communicate directly with the speakers. The festival hosts roundtable talks and debates that set up opposing viewpoints, and myth-busting talks challenging commonly held beliefs.[4][5] The aim is to create a challenging, intellectual, and inclusive environment.


History

Brain Bar was founded by Gergely Böszörményi-Nagy with the goal of creating a platform where attendees could discuss and debate big questions of the future, while drawing inspiration from well-known thinkers on a broad spectrum of disciplines.[6] The event addresses many topics related to how communities and humanity, as a whole, will live in the future.[7][8] [9]Aside from the question of how technology will transform our lives, the event grapples with future scenarios in the areas of business, politics and lifestyle topics. Brain Bar features multiple on-stage debate formats meant to encourage audience members' participation and challenge conventional thinking. Accompanying keynote presentations and debates, the festival also has artistic performances including DJ sets, live music and dance as an integral part of the program.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16]

Educational outreach

Each year, a large number of tickets are given away to European students and teachers to promote inclusivity.[32] In 2019, 5,000 students and teachers had the chance to attend the festival free of charge [33] Combining this attention to youth with the festival's focus on the future, in 2017 organizers launched a new platform, Future Jobs which offers specially selected future-proof jobs from the fields of communication, design, IT, services and business and gives "a unique opportunity for young people to learn what employers are looking for, to inform educators about the requirements of tomorrow, and to help employers learn more about today’s talent."[34]. In 2018 Brain Bar launched its business-focused workshops, Mastermind Sessions where Brain Bar speakers discuss, question and ideate around future trends driving society, culture and business. [35]
