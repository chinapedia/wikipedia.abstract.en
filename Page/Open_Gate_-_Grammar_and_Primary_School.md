The Grammar School

At the end of their studies at Open Gate, the students have the opportunity to sit for International Baccalaureate Diploma qualification, or the State Maturita.[8] In reality the great majority of students sit for both.[9] From year five (kvinta) education is delivered through the medium of the English language across the curriculum; an exception being Czech and Czech realia.

The application process for entry to the Grammar School includes a general assessment of expected knowledge, an IQ test, and an interview. Applicants for Grammar School study may try a mock exam well in advance. Candidates with excellent results at the mock exam only then have to sit the interview section of the application process at the given date.

All students have the opportunity to avail themselves of participation in the Duke of Edinburgh’s International Award scheme, (the DofE). Amongst the students successful on this scheme are Filip Chalupa and Lukáš Kotlár.
