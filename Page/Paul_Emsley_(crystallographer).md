PAUL EMSLEY is a British crystallographer and a member of the Computational Crystallography Group headed by Garib Murshudov[1] at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge.[2]

Emsley is the primary author of the model-building software Coot,[3][4] a tool for building models of proteins whose three dimensional structures are determined via X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM. These protein structures are deposited at the Worldwide Protein Data Bank for collaboration among scientists.[5] Since its introduction in 2004, Coot has remained as free software for use in industrial and academic research groups.

Emsley has given lectures and tutorials on model-building and validation at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and as CCP4 courses, where he is also a developer and contributor.[6]
