Once Venu slaps Prasad for misbehaving with passengers, and for that, Dayanandam makess false allegations against Venu and terminates him from the service. Meanwhile, Venu's sister is suffering from a disease and he wants money for her treatment. Suddenly, a person Gopala Rao (Rao Gopal Rao) arrives, who is ready to give the amount required for his sister's treatment; as a return he asks him for a favor. He tells Venu to cheat Prema as if he loves her so that he can take revenge on Jagapathi Rao for cheating his sister in the past. In the beginning, Venu doesn't agree, but later he accepts the proposal because he senses Jagapathi Rao as his mother Parvatamma's (Annapurna) killer. After that, Gopal Rao takes love classes to Venu and makes him trap Prema into his love. One day, Gopal Rao visits Jagapathi Rao's house and reveals his entire plan, where a shocking discovery occurs; Prema is none other than Gopal Rao's sister's daughter. Gopal Rao rapidly moves to stop his plan; when he reaches Venu and Prema, he plays a drama that they sexually interact with each other. He requests Venu to marry Prema, but he refuses because of his desire for revenge against Jagapathi Rao. When Prema forces her father to tell the truth, he reveals that the real culprit was Dayanandam and he trapped him into it. At last, Venu, Gopala Rao and Jagapathi Rao unite and send Dayanandam behind bars. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Venu & Prema.
