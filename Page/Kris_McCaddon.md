KRIS MCCADDON was the original guitarist for the metalcore band, Society's Finest and lead guitarist for Demon Hunter. He was also the vocalist for the bands Embodyment and The Famine.


History

McCaddon's career started in 1994 when he joined the band Embodyment.[1] They released their debut album, _Embrace the Eternal_, in 1997; it featured guest vocals by Living Sacrifice vocalist Bruce Fitzhugh. _Embrace the Eternal_ would later be re-released by their record label, Solid State Records. He left the band in 2000 before recording their second album, _The Narrow Scope of Things_. McCaddon started the band, along with Joshua Ashworth, Rob Pruett, Joel Bailey, and Chad Wilburn, Society's Finest. In 2000 they released an EP titled _Private Conflicts & Suicides_. Their debut album, _The Journey...So Far_, was released on Solid State Records in May 2000.[2]

In 2003 they took a short break, during which McCaddon decided to leave Society's Finest, and went on to join Demon Hunter. After leaving Society's Finest and Embodyment, Ryan Clark and Don Clark, formerly of Training for Utopia, recruited him, Jesse Sprinkle, formerly of Poor Old Lu, and Jon Dunn (Who would later join Soul Embraced) to join their project, Demon Hunter. Demon Hunter already had an album before he joined. On this album McCaddon had contributed by photography. On his Demon Hunter debut, _Summer of Darkness_, was great success. In 2005, Ethan Luck, formerly of The O.C. Supertones and Project 86, replaced McCaddon. In 2006, former Embodyment members, Mark Garza (drums) and Andrew Godwin (guitar), contacted McCaddon and said they wanted to play metal again. McCaddon contacted former Society's Finest member, Nick Nowell (bass) and asked him to join their new project, The Famine.[3] Though McCaddon knew people would compare the Famine to Embodyment, he stated that "We started The Famine because we wanted to get away from the stuff we were playing with Embodyment...".[4]

In 2007, they signed to Solid State Records and released their debut EP, _The Famine_. In 2008, they released their debut album, _The Raven and the Reaping_. In 2010, McCaddon departed The Famine and Nick Nowell took over vocals.[5][6] The Famine later broke-up in 2011. McCaddon is a former employee of Takehold Records[7] and Tooth & Nail Records.
