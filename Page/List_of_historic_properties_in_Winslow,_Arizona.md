Brief history

Winslow was founded in 1882 as a railroad town. It was named after General Edward F. Winslow, President of the St. Louis & Southwestern Railway.[1] By 1957, railroad travel had all but stopped. The now historical Route 66 (a.k.a. "The Mother Road"), was established in 1926, passing through the middle of the town in what is now Second Street. Travel by motorist on the historic route lessened with the construction of interstate 40.[2]

Winslow has two districts, four individual structures and one archaeological site listed in the National Register of Historic Places. They are the following:[3]


The Historic Preservation Commission of Winslow

The Historic Preservation Commission of Winslow is the agency in charge of identifying, preserving the towns historical structures. The commission is also in charge of nominating those structures which are considered historical to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Historic Preservation Commission of Winslow is located at 115 E. Second Street.[4] However, it must be noted that just because a property is listed in the NRHP it does not mean that the property is safe from being demolished by its owner. According to Jim McPherson, Arizona Preservation Foundation Board President: "It is crucial that residents, private interests, and government officials act now to save these elements of our cultural heritage before it is too late."[5]


Take It Easy"

In 1972, the Eagles, an American rock band, recorded the song "Take It Easy" which became a hit. The song includes he following verse: "Standing on the Corner in Winslow, Arizona". Since then the corner has become a tourist attraction. The corner and a statue are located in the intersection of Second and Kinsley Streets.[6]

The crater is also known as the Daniel Moreau Barringer Crater who 1909 claimed that the crater was the result of a meteorite impact. It was designated a National Natural Landmark (NNL) in November 1967. The NNL designation is made by the Secretary of the Interior after in-depth scientific study of a potential site. The crater is located on exit 233 off Interstate 40 in Winslow, Arizona.[11][12]
