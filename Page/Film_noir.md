_FILM NOIR_ (; ) is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly those that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. Hollywood's classical film noir period is generally regarded as extending from the early 1920s to the late 1950s. Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key, black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography. Many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Great Depression.

The term _film noir_, French for "black film" (literal) or "dark film" (closer meaning),[1] was first applied to Hollywood films by French critic Nino Frank in 1946, but was unrecognized by most American film industry professionals of that era.[2] Cinema historians and critics defined the category retrospectively. Before the notion was widely adopted in the 1970s, many of the classic film noir were referred to as "melodramas". Whether film noir qualifies as a distinct genre is a matter of ongoing debate among scholars.

Film noir encompasses a range of plots: the central figure may be a private investigator (_The Big Sleep_), a plainclothes policeman (_The Big Heat_), an aging boxer (_The Set-Up_), a hapless grifter (_Night and the City_), a law-abiding citizen lured into a life of crime (_Gun Crazy_), or simply a victim of circumstance (_D.O.A._). Although film noir was originally associated with American productions, the term has been used to describe films from around the world. Many films released from the 1960s onward share attributes with film noirs of the classical period, and often treat its conventions self-referentially. Some refer to such latter-day works as neo-noir. The clichés of film noir have inspired parody since the mid-1940s.


Problems of definition

The_stranger_(1946).webm'', full film]] The questions of what defines film noir, and what sort of category it is, provoke continuing debate.[3] "We'd be oversimplifying things in calling film noir oneiric, strange, erotic, ambivalent, and cruel ..."—this set of attributes constitutes the first of many attempts to define film noir made by French critics Raymond Borde and Étienne Chaumeton in their 1955 book _Panorama du film noir américain 1941–1953_ (_A Panorama of American Film Noir_), the original and seminal extended treatment of the subject.[4] They emphasize that not every film noir embodies all five attributes in equal measure—one might be more dreamlike; another, particularly brutal.[5] The authors' caveats and repeated efforts at alternative definition have been echoed in subsequent scholarship: in the more than five decades since, there have been innumerable further attempts at definition, yet in the words of cinema historian Mark Bould, film noir remains an "elusive phenomenon ... always just out of reach".[6]

Though film noir is often identified with a visual style, unconventional within a Hollywood context, that emphasizes low-key lighting and unbalanced compositions,[7] films commonly identified as noir evidence a variety of visual approaches, including ones that fit comfortably within the Hollywood mainstream.[8] Film noir similarly embraces a variety of genres, from the gangster film to the police procedural to the gothic romance to the social problem picture—any example of which from the 1940s and 1950s, now seen as noir's classical era, was likely to be described as a melodrama at the time.[9]

While many critics refer to film noir as a genre itself, others argue that it can be no such thing.[10] Foster Hirsch defines a genre as determined by "conventions of narrative structure, characterization, theme, and visual design". Hirsch, as one who has taken the position that film noir is a genre, argues that these elements are present "in abundance". Hirsch notes that there are unifying features of tone, visual style and narrative sufficient to classify noir as a distinct genre.[11]

Others argue that film noir is not a genre. Film noir is often associated with an urban setting, but many classic noirs take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road; setting, therefore, cannot be its genre determinant, as with the Western. Similarly, while the private eye and the femme fatale are character types conventionally identified with noir, the majority of film noirs feature neither; so there is no character basis for genre designation as with the gangster film. Nor does film noir rely on anything as evident as the monstrous or supernatural elements of the horror film, the speculative leaps of the science fiction film, or the song-and-dance routines of the musical.[12]

An analogous case is that of the screwball comedy, widely accepted by film historians as constituting a "genre": the screwball is defined not by a fundamental attribute, but by a general disposition and a group of elements, some—but rarely and perhaps never all—of which are found in each of the genre's films.[13] Because of the diversity of noir (much greater than that of the screwball comedy), certain scholars in the field, such as film historian Thomas Schatz, treat it as not a genre but a "style".[14] Alain Silver, the most widely published American critic specializing in film noir studies, refers to film noir as a "cycle"[15] and a "phenomenon",[16] even as he argues that it has—like certain genres—a consistent set of visual and thematic codes.[17] Other critics treat film noir as a "mood",[18] characterize it as a "series",[19] or simply address a chosen set of films they regard as belonging to the noir "canon".[20] There is no consensus on the matter.[21]


Background

The aesthetics of film noir are influenced by German Expressionism, an artistic movement of the 1910s and 1920s that involved theater, photography, painting, sculpture and architecture, as well as cinema. The opportunities offered by the booming Hollywood film industry and then the threat of Nazism, led to the emigration of many film artists working in Germany who had been involved in the Expressionist movement or studied with its practitioners.[22] _M_ (1931), shot only a few years before director Fritz Lang's departure from Germany, is among the first crime films of the sound era to join a characteristically noirish visual style with a noir-type plot, in which the protagonist is a criminal (as are his most successful pursuers). Directors such as Lang, Robert Siodmak and Michael Curtiz brought a dramatically shadowed lighting style and a psychologically expressive approach to visual composition (_mise-en-scène_), with them to Hollywood, where they made some of the most famous classic noirs.[23]

By 1931, Curtiz had already been in Hollywood for half a decade, making as many as six films a year. Movies of his such as _20,000 Years in Sing Sing_ (1932) and _Private Detective 62_ (1933) are among the early Hollywood sound films arguably classifiable as noir—scholar Marc Vernet offers the latter as evidence that dating the initiation of film noir to 1940 or any other year is "arbitrary".[24] Expressionism-orientated filmmakers had free stylistic rein in Universal horror pictures such as _Dracula_ (1931), _The Mummy_ (1932)—the former photographed and the latter directed by the Berlin-trained Karl Freund—and _The Black Cat_ (1934), directed by Austrian émigré Edgar G. Ulmer.[25] The Universal horror film that comes closest to noir, in story and sensibility is _The Invisible Man_ (1933), directed by Englishman James Whale and photographed by American Arthur Edeson. Edeson later photographed _The Maltese Falcon_ (1941), widely regarded as the first major film noir of the classic era.[26]

Josef von Sternberg was directing in Hollywood during the same period. Films of his such as _Shanghai Express_ (1932) and _The Devil Is a Woman_ (1935), with their hothouse eroticism and baroque visual style, anticipated central elements of classic noir. The commercial and critical success of Sternberg's silent _Underworld_ (1927) was largely responsible for spurring a trend of Hollywood gangster films.[27] Successful films in that genre such as _Little Caesar_ (1931), _The Public Enemy_ (1931) and _Scarface_ (1932) demonstrated that there was an audience for crime dramas with morally reprehensible protagonists.[28] An important, possibly influential, cinematic antecedent to classic noir was 1930s French poetic realism, with its romantic, fatalistic attitude and celebration of doomed heroes.[29] The movement's sensibility is mirrored in the Warner Bros. drama _I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang_ (1932), a forerunner of noir.[30] Among films not considered film noirs, perhaps none had a greater effect on the development of the genre than _Citizen Kane_ (1941), directed by Orson Welles. Its visual intricacy and complex, voiceover narrative structure are echoed in dozens of classic film noirs.[31]

Italian neorealism of the 1940s, with its emphasis on quasi-documentary authenticity, was an acknowledged influence on trends that emerged in American noir. _The Lost Weekend_ (1945), directed by Billy Wilder, another Vienna-born, Berlin-trained American auteur, tells the story of an alcoholic in a manner evocative of neorealism.[32] It also exemplifies the problem of classification: one of the first American films to be described as a film noir, it has largely disappeared from considerations of the field.[33] Director Jules Dassin of _The Naked City_ (1948) pointed to the neorealists as inspiring his use of location photography with non-professional extras. This semidocumentary approach characterized a substantial number of noirs in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Along with neorealism, the style had an American precedent cited by Dassin, in director Henry Hathaway's _The House on 92nd Street_ (1945), which demonstrated the parallel influence of the cinematic newsreel.[34]

Literary sources

The primary literary influence on film noir was the hardboiled school of American detective and crime fiction, led in its early years by such writers as Dashiell Hammett (whose first novel, _Red Harvest_, was published in 1929) and James M. Cain (whose _The Postman Always Rings Twice_ appeared five years later), and popularized in pulp magazines such as _Black Mask_. The classic film noirs _The Maltese Falcon_ (1941) and _The Glass Key_ (1942) were based on novels by Hammett; Cain's novels provided the basis for _Double Indemnity_ (1944), _Mildred Pierce_ (1945), _The Postman Always Rings Twice_ (1946), and _Slightly Scarlet_ (1956; adapted from _Love's Lovely Counterfeit_). A decade before the classic era, a story by Hammett was the source for the gangster melodrama _City Streets_ (1931), directed by Rouben Mamoulian and photographed by Lee Garmes, who worked regularly with Sternberg. Released the month before Lang's _M_, _City Streets_ has a claim to being the first major film noir; both its style and story had many noir characteristics.[36]

Raymond Chandler, who debuted as a novelist with _The Big Sleep_ in 1939, soon became the most famous author of the hardboiled school. Not only were Chandler's novels turned into major noirs—_Murder, My Sweet_ (1944; adapted from _Farewell, My Lovely_), _The Big Sleep_ (1946), and _Lady in the Lake_ (1947)—he was an important screenwriter in the genre as well, producing the scripts for _Double Indemnity_, _The Blue Dahlia_ (1946), and _Strangers on a Train_ (1951). Where Chandler, like Hammett, centered most of his novels and stories on the character of the private eye, Cain featured less heroic protagonists and focused more on psychological exposition than on crime solving;[37] the Cain approach has come to be identified with a subset of the hardboiled genre dubbed "noir fiction". For much of the 1940s, one of the most prolific and successful authors of this often downbeat brand of suspense tale was Cornell Woolrich (sometimes under the pseudonym George Hopley or William Irish). No writer's published work provided the basis for more film noirs of the classic period than Woolrich's: thirteen in all, including _Black Angel_ (1946), _Deadline at Dawn_ (1946), and _Fear in the Night_ (1947).[38]

Another crucial literary source for film noir was W. R. Burnett, whose first novel to be published was _Little Caesar_, in 1929. It was turned into a hit for Warner Bros. in 1931; the following year, Burnett was hired to write dialogue for _Scarface_, while _The Beast of the City_ (1932) was adapted from one of his stories. At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date.[39] Burnett's characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriots—his protagonists were often heroic in their own way, which happened to be that of the gangster. During the classic era, his work, either as author or screenwriter, was the basis for seven films now widely regarded as film noirs, including three of the most famous: _High Sierra_ (1941), _This Gun for Hire_ (1942), and _The Asphalt Jungle_ (1950).[40]


Classic period

Overview

The 1940s and 1950s are generally regarded as the "classic period" of American _film noir_. While _City Streets_ and other pre-WWII crime melodramas such as _Fury_ (1936) and _You Only Live Once_ (1937), both directed by Fritz Lang, are categorized as full-fledged _noir_ in Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward's _film noir_ encyclopedia, other critics tend to describe them as "proto-noir" or in similar terms.[41]

The film now most commonly cited as the first "true" _film noir_ is _Stranger on the Third Floor_ (1940), directed by Latvian-born, Soviet-trained Boris Ingster.[42] Hungarian émigré Peter Lorre—who had starred in Lang's _M_—was top-billed, although he did not play the primary lead. He later played secondary roles in several other formative American noirs. Although modestly budgeted, at the high end of the B movie scale, _Stranger on the Third Floor_ still lost its studio, RKO, US$56,000 (), almost a third of its total cost.[43] _Variety_ magazine found Ingster's work: "...too studied and when original, lacks the flare to hold attention. It's a film too arty for average audiences, and too humdrum for others."[44] _Stranger on the Third Floor_ was not recognized as the beginning of a trend, let alone a new genre, for many decades.[45]

Most film noirs of the classic period were similarly low- and modestly-budgeted features without major stars—B movies either literally or in spirit. In this production context, writers, directors, cinematographers, and other craftsmen were relatively free from typical big-picture constraints. There was more visual experimentation than in Hollywood filmmaking as a whole: the Expressionism now closely associated with noir and the semi-documentary style that later emerged represent two very different tendencies. Narrative structures sometimes involved convoluted flashbacks uncommon in non-noir commercial productions. In terms of content, enforcement of the Production Code ensured that no film character could literally get away with murder or be seen sharing a bed with anyone but a spouse; within those bounds, however, many films now identified as noir feature plot elements and dialogue that were very risqué for the time.[46]

OutOfThePastMitchumGreer.jpg'' (1947) features many of the genre's hallmarks: a cynical private detective as the protagonist, a femme fatale, multiple flashbacks with voiceover narration, dramatically shadowed photography, and a fatalistic mood leavened with provocative banter. The film stars noir icons Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer.]] Thematically, film noirs were most exceptional for the relative frequency with which they centered on women of questionable virtue—a focus that had become rare in Hollywood films after the mid-1930s and the end of the pre-Code era. The signal film in this vein was _Double Indemnity_, directed by Billy Wilder; setting the mold was Barbara Stanwyck's unforgettable femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson—an apparent nod to Marlene Dietrich, who had built her extraordinary career playing such characters for Sternberg. An A-level feature all the way, the film's commercial success and seven Oscar nominations made it probably the most influential of the early noirs.[47] A slew of now-renowned noir "bad girls" followed, such as those played by Rita Hayworth in _Gilda_ (1946), Lana Turner in _The Postman Always Rings Twice_ (1946), Ava Gardner in _The Killers_ (1946), and Jane Greer in _Out of the Past_ (1947). The iconic noir counterpart to the femme fatale, the private eye, came to the fore in films such as _The Maltese Falcon_ (1941), with Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade, and _Murder, My Sweet_ (1944), with Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe.

The prevalence of the private eye as a lead character declined in film noir of the 1950s, a period during which several critics describe the form as becoming more focused on extreme psychologies and more exaggerated in general.[48] A prime example is _Kiss Me Deadly_ (1955); based on a novel by Mickey Spillane, the best-selling of all the hardboiled authors, here the protagonist is a private eye, Mike Hammer. As described by Paul Schrader, "Robert Aldrich's teasing direction carries _noir_ to its sleaziest and most perversely erotic. Hammer overturns the underworld in search of the 'great whatsit' [which] turns out to be—joke of jokes—an exploding atomic bomb."[49] Orson Welles's baroquely styled _Touch of Evil_ (1958) is frequently cited as the last noir of the classic period.[50] Some scholars believe film noir never really ended, but continued to transform even as the characteristic noir visual style began to seem dated and changing production conditions led Hollywood in different directions—in this view, post-1950s films in the noir tradition are seen as part of a continuity with classic noir.[51] A majority of critics, however, regard comparable films made outside the classic era to be something other than genuine film noirs. They regard true film noir as belonging to a temporally and geographically limited cycle or period, treating subsequent films that evoke the classics as fundamentally different due to general shifts in filmmaking style and latter-day awareness of noir as a historical source for allusion.[52]

Directors and the business of noir

LonelyPlaceTrailer.jpg'' (1950), directed by Nicholas Ray and based on a novel by noir fiction writer Dorothy B. Hughes. Two of noir's defining actors, Gloria Grahame and Humphrey Bogart, portray star-crossed lovers in the film.]] While the inceptive noir, _Stranger on the Third Floor_, was a B picture directed by a virtual unknown, many of the film noirs still remembered were A-list productions by well-known film makers. Debuting as a director with _The Maltese Falcon_ (1941), John Huston followed with _Key Largo_ (1948) and _The Asphalt Jungle_ (1950). Opinion is divided on the noir status of several Alfred Hitchcock thrillers from the era; at least four qualify by consensus: _Shadow of a Doubt_ (1943), _Notorious_ (1946), _Strangers on a Train_ (1951) and _The Wrong Man_ (1956).[53] Otto Preminger's success with _Laura_ (1944) made his name and helped demonstrate noir's adaptability to a high-gloss 20th Century-Fox presentation.[54] Among Hollywood's most celebrated directors of the era, arguably none worked more often in a noir mode than Preminger; his other noirs include _Fallen Angel_ (1945), _Whirlpool_ (1949), _Where the Sidewalk Ends_ (1950) (all for Fox) and _Angel Face_ (1952). A half-decade after _Double Indemnity_ and _The Lost Weekend_, Billy Wilder made _Sunset Boulevard_ (1950) and _Ace in the Hole_ (1951), noirs that were not so much crime dramas as satires on Hollywood and the news media. _In a Lonely Place_ (1950) was Nicholas Ray's breakthrough; his other noirs include his debut, _They Live by Night_ (1948) and _On Dangerous Ground_ (1952), noted for their unusually sympathetic treatment of characters alienated from the social mainstream.[55]

Lady_from_Shanghai_trailer_rita_hayworth6.JPG in the trailer for _The Lady from Shanghai_ (1947)]] Orson Welles had notorious problems with financing but his three film noirs were well budgeted: _The Lady from Shanghai_ (1947) received top-level, "prestige" backing, while _The Stranger_, his most conventional film and _Touch of Evil_, an unmistakably personal work, were funded at levels lower but still commensurate with headlining releases.[56] Like _The Stranger_, Fritz Lang's _The Woman in the Window_ (1945) was a production of the independent International Pictures. Lang's follow-up, _Scarlet Street_ (1945), was one of the few classic noirs to be officially censored: filled with erotic innuendo, it was temporarily banned in Milwaukee, Atlanta and New York State.[57] _Scarlet Street_ was a semi-independent, cosponsored by Universal and Lang's Diana Productions, of which the film's co-star, Joan Bennett, was the second biggest shareholder. Lang, Bennett and her husband, the Universal veteran and Diana production head Walter Wanger, made _Secret Beyond the Door_ (1948) in similar fashion.[58]

Before leaving the United States while subject to the Hollywood blacklist, Jules Dassin made two classic noirs that also straddled the major–independent line: _Brute Force_ (1947) and the influential documentary-style _The Naked City_ were developed by producer Mark Hellinger, who had an "inside/outside" contract with Universal similar to Wanger's.[59] Years earlier, working at Warner Bros., Hellinger had produced three films for Raoul Walsh, the proto-noirs _They Drive by Night_ (1940), _Manpower_ (1941) and _High Sierra_ (1941), now regarded as a seminal work in noir's development.[60] Walsh had no great name during his half-century as a director but his noirs _White Heat_ (1949) and _The Enforcer_ (1951) had A-list stars and are seen as important examples of the cycle.[61] Other directors associated with top-of-the-bill Hollywood film noirs include Edward Dmytryk (_Murder, My Sweet_ [1944], _Crossfire_ [1947])—the first important noir director to fall prey to the industry blacklist—as well as Henry Hathaway (_The Dark Corner_ [1946], _Kiss of Death_ [1947]) and John Farrow (_The Big Clock_ [1948], _Night Has a Thousand Eyes_ [1948]).

Most of the Hollywood films considered to be classic noirs fall into the category of the "B movie".[62] Some were Bs in the most precise sense, produced to run on the bottom of double bills by a low-budget unit of one of the major studios or by one of the smaller Poverty Row outfits, from the relatively well-off Monogram to shakier ventures such as Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC). Jacques Tourneur had made over thirty Hollywood Bs (a few now highly regarded, most forgotten) before directing the A-level _Out of the Past_, described by scholar Robert Ottoson as "the _ne plus ultra_ of forties film noir".[63] Movies with budgets a step up the ladder, known as "intermediates" by the industry, might be treated as A or B pictures depending on the circumstances. Monogram created Allied Artists in the late 1940s to focus on this sort of production. Robert Wise (_Born to Kill_ [1947], _The Set-Up_ [1949]) and Anthony Mann (_T-Men_ [1947] and _Raw Deal_ [1948]) each made a series of impressive intermediates, many of them noirs, before graduating to steady work on big-budget productions. Mann did some of his most celebrated work with cinematographer John Alton, a specialist in what James Naremore called "hypnotic moments of light-in-darkness".[64] _He Walked by Night_ (1948), shot by Alton and though credited solely to Alfred Werker, directed in large part by Mann, demonstrates their technical mastery and exemplifies the late 1940s trend of "police procedural" crime dramas. It was released, like other Mann-Alton noirs, by the small Eagle-Lion company; it was the inspiration for the _Dragnet_ series, which debuted on radio in 1949 and television in 1951.[65] DetourPoster1.jpg'' (1945) cost $117,000 to make when the biggest Hollywood studios spent around $600,000 on the average feature. Produced at small PRC, however, the film was 30 percent over budget.[66]]] Several directors associated with noir built well-respected oeuvres largely at the B-movie/intermediate level. Samuel Fuller's brutal, visually energetic films such as _Pickup on South Street_ (1953) and _Underworld U.S.A._ (1961) earned him a unique reputation; his advocates praise him as "primitive" and "barbarous".[67][68] Joseph H. Lewis directed noirs as diverse as _Gun Crazy_ (1950) and _The Big Combo_ (1955). The former—whose screenplay was written by the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo, disguised by a front—features a bank hold-up sequence shown in an unbroken take of over three minutes that was influential.[69] _The Big Combo_ was shot by John Alton and took the shadowy noir style to its outer limits.[70] The most distinctive films of Phil Karlson (_The Phenix City Story_ [1955] and _The Brothers Rico_ [1957]) tell stories of vice organized on a monstrous scale.[71] The work of other directors in this tier of the industry, such as Felix E. Feist (_The Devil Thumbs a Ride_ [1947], _Tomorrow Is Another Day_ [1951]), has become obscure. Edgar G. Ulmer spent most of his Hollywood career working at B studios and once in a while on projects that achieved intermediate status; for the most part, on unmistakable Bs. In 1945, while at PRC, he directed a noir cult classic, _Detour_.[72] Ulmer's other noirs include _Strange Illusion_ (1945), also for PRC; _Ruthless_ (1948), for Eagle-Lion, which had acquired PRC the previous year and _Murder Is My Beat_ (1955), for Allied Artists.

A number of low- and modestly-budgeted noirs were made by independent, often actor-owned, companies contracting with larger studios for distribution. Serving as producer, writer, director and top-billed performer, Hugo Haas made films like _Pickup_ (1951) and _The Other Woman_ (1954). It was in this way that accomplished noir actress Ida Lupino established herself as the sole female director in Hollywood during the late 1940s and much of the 1950s. She does not appear in the best-known film she directed, _The Hitch-Hiker_ (1953), developed by her company, The Filmakers, with support and distribution by RKO.[73] It is one of the seven classic film noirs produced largely outside of the major studios that have been chosen for the United States National Film Registry. Of the others, one was a small-studio release: _Detour_. Four were independent productions distributed by United Artists, the "studio without a studio": _Gun Crazy_; _Kiss Me Deadly_; _D.O.A._ (1950), directed by Rudolph Maté and _Sweet Smell of Success_ (1957), directed by Alexander Mackendrick. One was an independent distributed by MGM, the industry leader: _Force of Evil_ (1948), directed by Abraham Polonsky and starring John Garfield, both of whom were blacklisted in the 1950s.[74] Independent production usually meant restricted circumstances but _Sweet Smell of Success_, despite the plans of the production team, was clearly not made on the cheap, though like many other cherished A-budget noirs, it might be said to have a B-movie soul.[75]

Perhaps no director better displayed that spirit than the German-born Robert Siodmak, who had already made a score of films before his 1940 arrival in Hollywood. Working mostly on A features, he made eight films now regarded as classic-era film noirs (a figure matched only by Lang and Mann).[76] In addition to _The Killers_, Burt Lancaster's debut and a Hellinger/Universal co-production, Siodmak's other important contributions to the genre include 1944's _Phantom Lady_ (a top-of-the-line B and Woolrich adaptation), the ironically titled _Christmas Holiday_ (1944), and _Cry of the City_ (1948). _Criss Cross_ (1949), with Lancaster again the lead, exemplifies how Siodmak brought the virtues of the B-movie to the A noir. In addition to the relatively looser constraints on character and message at lower budgets, the nature of B production lent itself to the noir style for economic reasons: dim lighting saved on electricity and helped cloak cheap sets (mist and smoke also served the cause); night shooting was often compelled by hurried production schedules; plots with obscure motivations and intriguingly elliptical transitions were sometimes the consequence of hastily written scripts, of which there was not always enough time or money to shoot every scene. In _Criss Cross_, Siodmak achieved these effects with purpose, wrapping them around Yvonne De Carlo, playing the most understandable of femme fatales; Dan Duryea, in one of his many charismatic villain roles; and Lancaster as an ordinary laborer turned armed robber, doomed by a romantic obsession.[77]

Outside the United States

Some critics regard classic film noir as a cycle exclusive to the United States; Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward, for example, argue, "With the Western, film noir shares the distinction of being an indigenous American form ... a wholly American film style."[78] However, although the term "film noir" was originally coined to describe Hollywood movies, it was an international phenomenon.[79] Even before the beginning of the generally accepted classic period, there were films made far from Hollywood that can be seen in retrospect as film noirs, for example, the French productions _Pépé le Moko_ (1937), directed by Julien Duvivier, and _Le Jour se lève_ (1939), directed by Marcel Carné.[80] In addition, Mexico experienced a vibrant film noir period from roughly 1946 to 1952, which was around the same time film noir was blossoming in the United States.[81]

During the classic period, there were many films produced in Europe, particularly in France, that share elements of style, theme, and sensibility with American film noirs and may themselves be included in the genre's canon. In certain cases, the interrelationship with Hollywood noir is obvious: American-born director Jules Dassin moved to France in the early 1950s as a result of the Hollywood blacklist, and made one of the most famous French film noirs, _Rififi_ (1955). Other well-known French films often classified as noir include _Quai des Orfèvres_ (1947) and _Les Diaboliques_ (1955), both directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot. _Casque d'Or_ (1952), _Touchez pas au grisbi_ (1954), and _Le Trou_ (1960) directed by Jacques Becker; and _Ascenseur pour l'échafaud_ (1958), directed by Louis Malle. French director Jean-Pierre Melville is widely recognized for his tragic, minimalist film noirs—_Bob le flambeur_ (1955), from the classic period, was followed by _Le Doulos_ (1962), _Le deuxième souffle_ (1966), _Le Samouraï_ (1967), and _Le Cercle rouge_ (1970).[82] StrayDogShadows.jpg'' (1949), directed and cowritten by Akira Kurosawa, contains many cinematographic and narrative elements associated with classic American film noir.]] Scholar Andrew Spicer argues that British film noir evidences a greater debt to French poetic realism than to the expressionistic American mode of noir.[83] Examples of British noir from the classic period include _Brighton Rock_ (1947), directed by John Boulting; _They Made Me a Fugitive_ (1947), directed by Alberto Cavalcanti; _The Small Back Room_ (1948), directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger; _The October Man_ (1950), directed by Roy Ward Baker; and _Cast a Dark Shadow_ (1955), directed by Lewis Gilbert. Terence Fisher directed several low-budget thrillers in a noir mode for Hammer Film Productions, including _The Last Page_ (a.k.a. _Man Bait_; 1952), _Stolen Face_ (1952), and _Murder by Proxy_ (a.k.a. _Blackout_; 1954). Before leaving for France, Jules Dassin had been obliged by political pressure to shoot his last English-language film of the classic noir period in Great Britain: _Night and the City_ (1950). Though it was conceived in the United States and was not only directed by an American but also stars two American actors—Richard Widmark and Gene Tierney—it is technically a UK production, financed by 20th Century-Fox's British subsidiary. The most famous of classic British noirs is director Carol Reed's _The Third Man_ (1949), from a screenplay by Graham Greene. Set in Vienna immediately after World War II, it also stars two American actors, Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles, who had appeared together in _Citizen Kane_.[84]

Elsewhere, Italian director Luchino Visconti adapted Cain's _The Postman Always Rings Twice_ as _Ossessione_ (1943), regarded both as one of the great noirs and a seminal film in the development of neorealism.[85] (This was not even the first screen version of Cain's novel, having been preceded by the French _Le Dernier Tournant_ in 1939.)[86] In Japan, the celebrated Akira Kurosawa directed several films recognizable as film noirs, including _Drunken Angel_ (1948), _Stray Dog_ (1949), _The Bad Sleep Well_ (1960), and _High and Low_ (1963).[87]

Among the first major neo-noir films—the term often applied to films that consciously refer back to the classic noir tradition—was the French _Tirez sur le pianiste_ (1960), directed by François Truffaut from a novel by one of the gloomiest of American noir fiction writers, David Goodis.[88] Noir crime films and melodramas have been produced in many countries in the post-classic area. Some of these are quintessentially self-aware neo-noirs—for example, _Il Conformista_ (1969; Italy), _Der Amerikanische Freund_ (1977; Germany), _The Element of Crime_ (1984; Denmark), and _El Aura_ (2005; Argentina). Others simply share narrative elements and a version of the hardboiled sensibility associated with classic noir, such as _Castle of Sand_ (1974; Japan), _Insomnia_ (1997; Norway), _Croupier_ (1998; UK), and _Blind Shaft_ (2003; China).[89]


Neo-noir and echoes of the classic mode

The neo-noir film genre developed mid-way into the Cold War. This cinematological trend reflected much of the cynicism and the possibility of nuclear annihilation of the era. This new genre introduced innovations that were not available with the earlier noir films. The violence was also more potent.[90]

1960s and 1970s

While it is hard to draw a line between some of the noir films of the early 1960s such as _Blast of Silence_ (1961) and _Cape Fear_ (1962) and the noirs of the late 1950s, new trends emerged in the post-classic era. _The Manchurian Candidate_ (1962), directed by John Frankenheimer, _Shock Corridor_ (1963), directed by Samuel Fuller, and _Brainstorm_ (1965), directed by experienced noir character actor William Conrad, all treat the theme of mental dispossession within stylistic and tonal frameworks derived from classic film noir.[91] _The Manchurian Candidate_ examined the situation of American prisoners of war (POWs) during the Korean War. Incidents that occurred during the war as well as those post-war, functioned as an inspiration for a "Cold War Noir" subgenre.[92][93] The television series _The Fugitive_ (1963–67) brought classic noir themes and mood to the small screen for an extended run.[94]

Here he imitates a characteristic Bogart gesture, one of the film's motifs.[95]]] In a different vein, films began to appear that self-consciously acknowledged the conventions of classic film noir as historical archetypes to be revived, rejected, or reimagined. These efforts typify what came to be known as neo-noir.[96] Though several late classic noirs, _Kiss Me Deadly_ in particular, were deeply self-knowing and post-traditional in conception, none tipped its hand so evidently as to be remarked on by American critics at the time.[97] The first major film to overtly work this angle was French director Jean-Luc Godard's _À bout de souffle_ (_Breathless_; 1960), which pays its literal respects to Bogart and his crime films while brandishing a bold new style for a new day.[98] In the United States, Arthur Penn (1965's _Mickey One_, drawing inspiration from Truffaut's _Tirez sur le pianiste_ and other French New Wave films), John Boorman (1967's _Point Blank_, similarly caught up, though in the _Nouvelle vague'_s deeper waters), and Alan J. Pakula (1971's _Klute_) directed films that knowingly related themselves to the original film noirs, inviting audiences in on the game.[99]

A manifest affiliation with noir traditions—which, by its nature, allows different sorts of commentary on them to be inferred—can also provide the basis for explicit critiques of those traditions. In 1973, director Robert Altman flipped off noir piety with _The Long Goodbye_. Based on the novel by Raymond Chandler, it features one of Bogart's most famous characters, but in iconoclastic fashion: Philip Marlowe, the prototypical hardboiled detective, is replayed as a hapless misfit, almost laughably out of touch with contemporary mores and morality.[100] Where Altman's subversion of the film noir mythos was so irreverent as to outrage some contemporary critics,[101] around the same time Woody Allen was paying affectionate, at points idolatrous homage to the classic mode with _Play It Again, Sam_ (1972). The "blaxploitation" film _Shaft_ (1971), wherein Richard Roundtree plays the titular African-American private eye, John Shaft, takes conventions from classic noir.

The most acclaimed of the neo-noirs of the era was director Roman Polanski's 1974 _Chinatown_.[102] Written by Robert Towne, it is set in 1930s Los Angeles, an accustomed noir locale nudged back some few years in a way that makes the pivotal loss of innocence in the story even crueler. Where Polanski and Towne raised noir to a black apogee by turning rearward, director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader brought the noir attitude crashing into the present day with _Taxi Driver_ (1976), a crackling, bloody-minded gloss on bicentennial America.[103] In 1978, Walter Hill wrote and directed _The Driver_, a chase film as might have been imagined by Jean-Pierre Melville in an especially abstract mood.[104]

Hill was already a central figure in 1970s noir of a more straightforward manner, having written the script for director Sam Peckinpah's _The Getaway_ (1972), adapting a novel by pulp master Jim Thompson, as well as for two tough private eye films: an original screenplay for _Hickey & Boggs_ (1972) and an adaptation of a novel by Ross Macdonald, the leading literary descendant of Hammett and Chandler, for _The Drowning Pool_ (1975). Some of the strongest 1970s noirs, in fact, were unwinking remakes of the classics, "neo" mostly by default: the heartbreaking _Thieves Like Us_ (1973), directed by Altman from the same source as Ray's _They Live by Night_, and _Farewell, My Lovely_ (1975), the Chandler tale made classically as _Murder, My Sweet_, remade here with Robert Mitchum in his last notable noir role.[105] Detective series, prevalent on American television during the period, updated the hardboiled tradition in different ways, but the show conjuring the most noir tone was a horror crossover touched with shaggy, _Long Goodbye_-style humor: _Kolchak: The Night Stalker_ (1974–75), featuring a Chicago newspaper reporter investigating strange, usually supernatural occurrences.[106]

1980s and 1990s

The turn of the decade brought Scorsese's black-and-white _Raging Bull_ (cowritten by Schrader); an acknowledged masterpiece—the American Film Institute ranks it as the greatest American film of the 1980s and the fourth greatest of all time—it is also a retreat, telling a story of a boxer's moral self-destruction that recalls in both theme and visual ambience noir dramas such as _Body and Soul_ (1947) and _Champion_ (1949).[108] From 1981, the popular _Body Heat_, written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan, invokes a different set of classic noir elements, this time in a humid, erotically charged Florida setting; its success confirmed the commercial viability of neo-noir, at a time when the major Hollywood studios were becoming increasingly risk averse. The mainstreaming of neo-noir is evident in such films as _Black Widow_ (1987), _Shattered_ (1991), and _Final Analysis_ (1992).[109] Few neo-noirs have made more money or more wittily updated the tradition of the noir double-entendre than _Basic Instinct_ (1992), directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas.[110] The film also demonstrates how neo-noir's polychrome palette can reproduce many of the expressionistic effects of classic black-and-white noir.[111]

Among big-budget auteurs, Michael Mann has worked frequently in a neo-noir mode, with such films as _Thief_ (1981) and _Heat_ (1995) and the TV series _Miami Vice_ (1984–89) and _Crime Story_ (1986–88). Mann's output exemplifies a primary strain of neo-noir (or as affectionately called "neon noir") [112], in which classic themes and tropes are revisited in a contemporary setting with an up-to-date visual style and rock- or hip hop-based musical soundtrack.[113] Like _Chinatown_, its more complex predecessor, Curtis Hanson's Oscar-winning _L.A. Confidential_ (1997), based on the James Ellroy novel, demonstrates an opposite tendency—the deliberately retro film noir; its tale of corrupt cops and femmes fatales is seemingly lifted straight from a film of 1953, the year in which it is set.[114] Director David Fincher followed the immensely successful neo-noir _Seven_ (1995) with a film that developed into a cult favorite after its original, disappointing release: _Fight Club_ (1999) is a _sui generis_ mix of noir aesthetic, perverse comedy, speculative content, and satiric intent.[115] Working generally with much smaller budgets, brothers Joel and Ethan Coen have created one of the most extensive film oeuvres influenced by classic noir, with films such as _Blood Simple_ (1984) and _Fargo_ (1996), considered by some a supreme work in the neo-noir mode.[116] The Coens cross noir with other generic lines in the gangster drama _Miller's Crossing_ (1990)—loosely based on the Dashiell Hammett novels _Red Harvest_ and _The Glass Key_—and the comedy _The Big Lebowski_ (1998), a tribute to Chandler and an homage to Altman's version of _The Long Goodbye_.[117] The characteristic work of David Lynch combines film noir tropes with scenarios driven by disturbed characters such as the sociopathic criminal played by Dennis Hopper in _Blue Velvet_ (1986) and the delusionary protagonist of _Lost Highway_ (1997). The _Twin Peaks_ cycle, both TV series (1990–91) and film, _Fire Walk with Me_ (1992), puts a detective plot through a succession of bizarre spasms. David Cronenberg also mixes surrealism and noir in _Naked Lunch_ (1991), inspired by William S. Burroughs' novel.

Perhaps no American neo-noirs better reflect the classic noir A-movie-with-a-B-movie-soul than those of director-writer Quentin Tarantino;[118] neo-noirs of his such as _Reservoir Dogs_ (1992) and _Pulp Fiction_ (1994) display a relentlessly self-reflexive, sometimes tongue-in-cheek sensibility, similar to the work of the New Wave directors and the Coens. Other films from the era readily identifiable as neo-noir (some retro, some more au courant) include director John Dahl's _Kill Me Again_ (1989), _Red Rock West_ (1992), and _The Last Seduction_ (1993); four adaptations of novels by Jim Thompson—_The Kill-Off_ (1989), _After Dark, My Sweet_ (1990), _The Grifters_ (1990), and the remake of _The Getaway_ (1994); and many more, including adaptations of the work of other major noir fiction writers: _The Hot Spot_ (1990), from _Hell Hath No Fury_, by Charles Williams; _Miami Blues_ (1990), from the novel by Charles Willeford; and _Out of Sight_ (1998), from the novel by Elmore Leonard.[119] Several films by director-writer David Mamet involve noir elements: _House of Games_ (1987), _Homicide_ (1991), _The Spanish Prisoner_ (1997), and _Heist_ (2001).[120] On television, _Moonlighting_ (1985–89) paid homage to classic noir while demonstrating an unusual appreciation of the sense of humor often found in the original cycle.[121] Between 1983 and 1989, Mickey Spillane's hardboiled private eye Mike Hammer was played with wry gusto by Stacy Keach in a series and several stand-alone television films (an unsuccessful revival followed in 1997–98). The British miniseries _The Singing Detective_ (1986), written by Dennis Potter, tells the story of a mystery writer named Philip Marlow; widely considered one of the finest neo-noirs in any medium, some critics rank it among the greatest television productions of all time.[122]

2000s and 2010s

The Coen brothers make reference to the noir tradition again with _The Man Who Wasn't There_ (2001); a black-and-white crime melodrama set in 1949, it features a scene apparently staged to mirror one from _Out of the Past_. Lynch's _Mulholland Drive_ (2001) continued in his characteristic vein, making the classic noir setting of Los Angeles the venue for a noir-inflected psychological jigsaw puzzle. British-born director Christopher Nolan's black-and-white debut, _Following_ (1998), was an overt homage to classic noir. During the new century's first decade, he was one of the leading Hollywood directors of neo-noir with the acclaimed _Memento_ (2000) and the remake of _Insomnia_ (2002).[123]

Director Sean Penn's _The Pledge_ (2001), though adapted from a very self-reflexive novel by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, plays noir comparatively straight, to devastating effect.[124] Screenwriter David Ayer updated the classic noir bad-cop tale, typified by _Shield for Murder_ (1954) and _Rogue Cop_ (1954), with his scripts for _Training Day_ (2001) and, adapting a story by James Ellroy, _Dark Blue_ (2002); he later wrote and directed the even darker _Harsh Times_ (2006). Michael Mann's _Collateral_ (2004) features a performance by Tom Cruise as an assassin in the lineage of _Le Samouraï_. The torments of _The Machinist_ (2004), directed by Brad Anderson, evoke both _Fight Club_ and _Memento_.[125] In 2005, Shane Black directed _Kiss Kiss Bang Bang_, basing his screenplay in part on a crime novel by Brett Halliday, who published his first stories back in the 1920s. The film plays with an awareness not only of classic noir but also of neo-noir reflexivity itself.[126]

With ultra-violent films such as _Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance_ (2002) and _Thirst_ (2009), Park Chan-wook of South Korea has been the most prominent director outside of the United States to work regularly in a noir mode in the new millennium.[127] The most commercially successful neo-noir of this period has been _Sin City_ (2005), directed by Robert Rodriguez in extravagantly stylized black and white with splashes of color.[128] The film is based on a series of comic books created by Frank Miller (credited as the film's codirector), which are in turn openly indebted to the works of Spillane and other pulp mystery authors.[129] Similarly, graphic novels provide the basis for _Road to Perdition_ (2002), directed by Sam Mendes, and _A History of Violence_ (2005), directed by David Cronenberg; the latter was voted best film of the year in the annual _Village Voice_ poll.[130] Writer-director Rian Johnson's _Brick_ (2005), featuring present-day high schoolers speaking a version of 1930s hardboiled argot, won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival. The television series _Veronica Mars_ (2004–07) also brought a youth-oriented twist to film noir. Examples of this sort of generic crossover have been dubbed "teen noir".[131]

Neo-noir films released in the 2010s include Kim Jee-woon’s _I Saw the Devil_ (2010), Fred Cavaye’s _Point Blank_ (2010), Na Hong-jin’s _The Yellow Sea_ (2010), Nicolas Winding Refn’s _Drive_ (2011),[132] and Claire Denis' _Bastards_ (2013).[133][134]

Science fiction noir

Like many classic noirs, the film is set in a version of Los Angeles where it constantly rains.[135] The steam in the foreground is a familiar noir trope, while the "bluish-smoky exterior" updates the black-and-white mode.[136]]]

In the post-classic era, a significant trend in noir crossovers has involved science fiction. In Jean-Luc Godard's _Alphaville_ (1965), Lemmy Caution is the name of the old-school private eye in the city of tomorrow. _The Groundstar Conspiracy_ (1972) centers on another implacable investigator and an amnesiac named Welles. _Soylent Green_ (1973), the first major American example, portrays a dystopian, near-future world via a self-evidently noir detection plot; starring Charlton Heston (the lead in _Touch of Evil_), it also features classic noir standbys Joseph Cotten, Edward G. Robinson, and Whit Bissell. The film was directed by Richard Fleischer, who two decades before had directed several strong B noirs, including _Armored Car Robbery_ (1950) and _The Narrow Margin_ (1952).[137]

The cynical and stylish perspective of classic film noir had a formative effect on the cyberpunk genre of science fiction that emerged in the early 1980s; the film most directly influential on cyberpunk was _Blade Runner_ (1982), directed by Ridley Scott, which pays evocative homage to the classic noir mode[138] (Scott subsequently directed the poignant noir crime melodrama _Someone to Watch Over Me_ (1987)). Scholar Jamaluddin Bin Aziz has observed how "the shadow of Philip Marlowe lingers on" in such other "future noir" films as _12 Monkeys_ (1995), _Dark City_ (1998) and _Minority Report_ (2002).[139] Fincher's feature debut was _Alien 3_ (1992), which evoked the classic noir jail film _Brute Force_.

David Cronenberg's _Crash_ (1996), an adaptation of the speculative novel by J. G. Ballard, has been described as a "film noir in bruise tones".[140] The hero is the target of investigation in _Gattaca_ (1997), which fuses film noir motifs with a scenario indebted to _Brave New World_. _The Thirteenth Floor_ (1999), like _Blade Runner_, is an explicit homage to classic noir, in this case involving speculations about virtual reality. Science fiction, noir, and anime are brought together in the Japanese films of 90s _Ghost in the Shell_ (1995) and _Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence_ (2004), both directed by Mamoru Oshii.[141] _The Animatrix_ (2003), based on and set within the world of _The Matrix_ film trilogy, contains an anime short film in classic noir style titled "A Detective Story".[142] Anime television series with science fiction noir themes include _Noir_ (2001)[143] and _Cowboy Bebop_ (1998).[144]

The 2015 film _Ex Machina_ puts an understated film noir spin on the Frankenstein mythos, with the sentient android Ava as a potential _femme fatale_, her creator Nathan embodying the abusive husband or father trope, and her would-be rescuer Caleb as a "clueless drifter" enthralled by Ava.[145]


Parodies

Film noir has been parodied many times in many manners. In 1945, Danny Kaye starred in what appears to be the first intentional film noir parody, _Wonder Man_.[146] That same year, Deanna Durbin was the singing lead in the comedic noir _Lady on a Train_, which makes fun of Woolrich-brand wistful miserablism. Bob Hope inaugurated the private-eye noir parody with _My Favorite Brunette_ (1947), playing a baby-photographer who is mistaken for an ironfisted detective.[147] In 1947 as well, The Bowery Boys appeared in _Hard Boiled Mahoney_, which had a similar mistaken-identity plot; they spoofed the genre once more in _Private Eyes_ (1953). Two RKO productions starring Robert Mitchum take film noir over the border into self-parody: _The Big Steal_ (1949), directed by Don Siegel, and _His Kind of Woman_ (1951). The "Girl Hunt" ballet in Vincente Minnelli's _The Band Wagon_ (1953) is a ten-minute distillation of—and play on—noir in dance.[148] _The Cheap Detective_ (1978), starring Peter Falk, is a broad spoof of several films, including the Bogart classics _The Maltese Falcon_ and _Casablanca_. Carl Reiner's black-and-white _Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid_ (1982) appropriates clips of classic noirs for a farcical pastiche, while his _Fatal Instinct_ (1993) sends up noir classic (_Double Indemnity_) and neo-noir (_Basic Instinct_). Robert Zemeckis's _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ (1988) develops a noir plot set in 1940s L.A. around a host of cartoon characters.[149]

Noir parodies come in darker tones as well. _Murder by Contract_ (1958), directed by Irving Lerner, is a deadpan joke on noir, with a denouement as bleak as any of the films it kids. An ultra-low-budget Columbia Pictures production, it may qualify as the first intentional example of what is now called a neo-noir film; it was likely a source of inspiration for both Melville's _Le Samouraï_ and Scorsese's _Taxi Driver_.[150] Belying its parodic strain, _The Long Goodbye_{{'}}s final act is seriously grave. _Taxi Driver_ caustically deconstructs the "dark" crime film, taking it to an absurd extreme and then offering a conclusion that manages to mock every possible anticipated ending—triumphant, tragic, artfully ambivalent—while being each, all at once.[151] Flirting with splatter status even more brazenly, the Coens' _Blood Simple_ is both an exacting pastiche and a gross exaggeration of classic noir.[152] Adapted by director Robinson Devor from a novel by Charles Willeford, _The Woman Chaser_ (1999) sends up not just the noir mode but the entire Hollywood filmmaking process, with seemingly each shot staged as the visual equivalent of an acerbic Marlowe wisecrack.[153]

In other media, the television series _Sledge Hammer!_ (1986–88) lampoons noir, along with such topics as capital punishment, gun fetishism, and Dirty Harry. _Sesame Street_ (1969–curr.) occasionally casts Kermit the Frog as a private eye; the sketches refer to some of the typical motifs of noir films, in particular the voiceover. Garrison Keillor's radio program _A Prairie Home Companion_ features the recurring character Guy Noir, a hardboiled detective whose adventures always wander into farce (Guy also appears in the Altman-directed film based on Keillor's show). Firesign Theatre's Nick Danger has trod the same not-so-mean streets, both on radio and in comedy albums. Cartoons such as _Garfield's Babes and Bullets_ (1989) and comic strip characters such as Tracer Bullet of _Calvin and Hobbes_ have parodied both film noir and the kindred hardboiled tradition—one of the sources from which film noir sprang and which it now overshadows.[154]


Identifying characteristics

VertigoHangTrailer.jpg'' (1958) a noir on the basis of plot and tone and various motifs, but _Vertigo_ does not have an Art Deco set, has a modernist graphic design typical of the 1950s and a more modern set design, the _Vertigo_ poster was made by Saul Bass,[155] something that would remove it from the category of film noir. Others say the combination of color and the specificity of director Alfred Hitchcock's vision exclude it from the category.[156]]]

In their original 1955 canon of film noir, Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumeton identified twenty-two Hollywood films released between 1941 and 1952 as core examples; they listed another fifty-nine American films from the period as significantly related to the field of noir.[157] A half-century later, film historians and critics had come to agree on a canon of approximately three hundred films from 1940–58.[158] There remain, however, many differences of opinion over whether other films of the era, among them a number of well-known ones, qualify as film noirs or not. For instance, _The Night of the Hunter_ (1955), starring Robert Mitchum in an acclaimed performance, is treated as a film noir by some critics, but not by others.[159] Some critics include _Suspicion_ (1941), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, in their catalogues of noir; others ignore it.[160] Concerning films made either before or after the classic period, or outside of the United States at any time, consensus is even rarer.

To support their categorization of certain films as noirs and their rejection of others, many critics refer to a set of elements they see as marking examples of the mode. The question of what constitutes the set of noir's identifying characteristics is a fundamental source of controversy. For instance, critics tend to define the model film noir as having a tragic or bleak conclusion,[161] but many acknowledged classics of the genre have clearly happy endings (e.g., _Stranger on the Third Floor,_ _The Big Sleep_, _Dark Passage_, and _The Dark Corner_), while the tone of many other noir denouements is ambivalent.[162] Some critics perceive classic noir's hallmark as a distinctive visual style. Others, observing that there is actually considerable stylistic variety among noirs, instead emphasize plot and character type. Still others focus on mood and attitude. No survey of classic noir's identifying characteristics can therefore be considered definitive. In the 1990s and 2000s, critics have increasingly turned their attention to that diverse field of films called neo-noir; once again, there is even less consensus about the defining attributes of such films made outside the classic period.[163]

Visual style

The low-key lighting schemes of many classic film noirs are associated with stark light/dark contrasts and dramatic shadow patterning—a style known as chiaroscuro (a term adopted from Renaissance painting). The shadows of Venetian blinds or banister rods, cast upon an actor, a wall, or an entire set, are an iconic visual in noir and had already become a cliché well before the neo-noir era. Characters' faces may be partially or wholly obscured by darkness—a relative rarity in conventional Hollywood filmmaking. While black-and-white cinematography is considered by many to be one of the essential attributes of classic noir, the color films _Leave Her to Heaven_ (1945) and _Niagara_ (1953) are routinely included in noir filmographies, while _Slightly Scarlet_ (1956), _Party Girl_ (1958), and _Vertigo_ (1958) are classified as noir by varying numbers of critics.[164]

Film noir is also known for its use of low-angle, wide-angle, and skewed, or Dutch angle shots. Other devices of disorientation relatively common in film noir include shots of people reflected in one or more mirrors, shots through curved or frosted glass or other distorting objects (such as during the strangulation scene in _Strangers on a Train_), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. Night-for-night shooting, as opposed to the Hollywood norm of day-for-night, was often employed.[165] From the mid-1940s forward, location shooting became increasingly frequent in noir.[166]

In an analysis of the visual approach of _Kiss Me Deadly_, a late and self-consciously stylized example of classic noir, critic Alain Silver describes how cinematographic choices emphasize the story's themes and mood. In one scene, the characters, seen through a "confusion of angular shapes", thus appear "caught in a tangible vortex or enclosed in a trap." Silver makes a case for how "side light is used ... to reflect character ambivalence", while shots of characters in which they are lit from below "conform to a convention of visual expression which associates shadows cast upward of the face with the unnatural and ominous".[167]

Structure and narrational devices

SorryWrongNumber2.jpg and Burt Lancaster were two of the most prolific stars of classic noir. The complex structure of _Sorry, Wrong Number_ (1948) involves a real-time framing story, multiple narrators, and flashbacks within flashbacks.[168]]]

Film noirs tend to have unusually convoluted story lines, frequently involving flashbacks and other editing techniques that disrupt and sometimes obscure the narrative sequence. Framing the entire primary narrative as a flashback is also a standard device. Voiceover narration, sometimes used as a structuring device, came to be seen as a noir hallmark; while classic noir is generally associated with first-person narration (i.e., by the protagonist), Stephen Neale notes that third-person narration is common among noirs of the semidocumentary style.[169] Neo-noirs as varied as _The Element of Crime_ (surrealist), _After Dark, My Sweet_ (retro), and _Kiss Kiss Bang Bang_ (meta) have employed the flashback/voiceover combination.

Bold experiments in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era: _Lady in the Lake_, for example, is shot entirely from the point of view of protagonist Philip Marlowe; the face of star (and director) Robert Montgomery is seen only in mirrors.[170] _The Chase_ (1946) takes oneirism and fatalism as the basis for its fantastical narrative system, redolent of certain horror stories, but with little precedent in the context of a putatively realistic genre. In their different ways, both _Sunset Boulevard_ and _D.O.A._ are tales told by dead men. Latter-day noir has been in the forefront of structural experimentation in popular cinema, as exemplified by such films as _Pulp Fiction_, _Fight Club_, and _Memento_.[171]

Plots, characters, and settings

Crime, usually murder, is an element of almost all film noirs; in addition to standard-issue greed, jealousy is frequently the criminal motivation. A crime investigation—by a private eye, a police detective (sometimes acting alone), or a concerned amateur—is the most prevalent, but far from dominant, basic plot. In other common plots the protagonists are implicated in heists or con games, or in murderous conspiracies often involving adulterous affairs. False suspicions and accusations of crime are frequent plot elements, as are betrayals and double-crosses. According to J. David Slocum, "protagonists assume the literal identities of dead men in nearly fifteen percent of all noir."[172] Amnesia is fairly epidemic—"noir's version of the common cold", in the words of film historian Lee Server.[173]

Film noirs tend to revolve around heroes who are more flawed and morally questionable than the norm, often fall guys of one sort or another. The characteristic protagonists of noir are described by many critics as "alienated";[175] in the words of Silver and Ward, "filled with existential bitterness".[176] Certain archetypal characters appear in many film noirs—hardboiled detectives, femme fatales, corrupt policemen, jealous husbands, intrepid claims adjusters, and down-and-out writers. Among characters of every stripe, cigarette smoking is rampant.[177] From historical commentators to neo-noir pictures to pop culture ephemera, the private eye and the femme fatale have been adopted as the quintessential film noir figures, though they do not appear in most films now regarded as classic noir. Of the twenty-six National Film Registry noirs, in only four does the star play a private eye: _The Maltese Falcon_, _The Big Sleep_, _Out of the Past_, and _Kiss Me Deadly_. Just four others readily qualify as detective stories: _Laura_, _The Killers_, _The Naked City_, and _Touch of Evil_. There is usually an element of drug or alcohol use, particularly as part of the detective's method to solving the crime, as an example the character of Mike Hammer in the 1955 film _Kiss Me Deadly_ who walks into a bar saying "Give me a double bourbon, and leave the bottle". Chaumeton and Borde have argued that film noir grew out of the "literature of drugs and alcohol".[178]

Film noir is often associated with an urban setting, and a few cities—Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, in particular—are the location of many of the classic films. In the eyes of many critics, the city is presented in noir as a "labyrinth" or "maze".[179] Bars, lounges, nightclubs, and gambling dens are frequently the scene of action. The climaxes of a substantial number of film noirs take place in visually complex, often industrial settings, such as refineries, factories, trainyards, power plants—most famously the explosive conclusion of _White Heat_, set at a chemical plant.[180] In the popular (and, frequently enough, critical) imagination, in noir it is always night and it always rains.[181]

A substantial trend within latter-day noir—dubbed "film soleil" by critic D. K. Holm—heads in precisely the opposite direction, with tales of deception, seduction, and corruption exploiting bright, sun-baked settings, stereotypically the desert or open water, to searing effect. Significant predecessors from the classic and early post-classic eras include _The Lady from Shanghai_; the Robert Ryan vehicle _Inferno_ (1953); the French adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's _The Talented Mr. Ripley_, _Plein soleil_ (_Purple Noon_ in the United States, more accurately rendered elsewhere as _Blazing Sun_ or _Full Sun_; 1960); and director Don Siegel's version of _The Killers_ (1964). The tendency was at its peak during the late 1980s and 1990s, with films such as _Dead Calm_ (1989), _After Dark, My Sweet_ (1990), _The Hot Spot_ (1990), _Delusion_ (1991), _Red Rock West_ (1993) and the television series _Miami Vice_.[182]

Worldview, morality, and tone

Film noir is often described as essentially pessimistic.[183] The noir stories that are regarded as most characteristic tell of people trapped in unwanted situations (which, in general, they did not cause but are responsible for exacerbating), striving against random, uncaring fate, and frequently doomed. The films are seen as depicting a world that is inherently corrupt.[184] Classic film noir has been associated by many critics with the American social landscape of the era—in particular, with a sense of heightened anxiety and alienation that is said to have followed World War II. In author Nicholas Christopher's opinion, "it is as if the war, and the social eruptions in its aftermath, unleashed demons that had been bottled up in the national psyche."[185] Film noirs, especially those of the 1950s and the height of the Red Scare, are often said to reflect cultural paranoia; _Kiss Me Deadly_ is the noir most frequently marshaled as evidence for this claim.[186]

Film noir is often said to be defined by "moral ambiguity",[187] yet the Production Code obliged almost all classic noirs to see that steadfast virtue was ultimately rewarded and vice, in the absence of shame and redemption, severely punished (however dramatically incredible the final rendering of mandatory justice might be). A substantial number of latter-day noirs flout such conventions: vice emerges triumphant in films as varied as the grim _Chinatown_ and the ribald _Hot Spot_.[188]

The tone of film noir is generally regarded as downbeat; some critics experience it as darker still—"overwhelmingly black", according to Robert Ottoson.[189] Influential critic (and filmmaker) Paul Schrader wrote in a seminal 1972 essay that "_film noir_ is defined by tone", a tone he seems to perceive as "hopeless".[190] In describing the adaptation of _Double Indemnity,_ noir analyst Foster Hirsch describes the "requisite hopeless tone" achieved by the filmmakers, which appears to characterize his view of noir as a whole.[191] On the other hand, definitive film noirs such as _The Big Sleep_, _The Lady from Shanghai_, _Scarlet Street_ and _Double Indemnity_ itself are famed for their hardboiled repartee, often imbued with sexual innuendo and self-reflexive humor.[192]

Notes

1.  The plural forms of _film noir_ in English include _films noirs_ (derived from the French), _films noir_, and _film noirs_. Merriam-Webster, which acknowledges all three styles as acceptable, favors _film noirs_,[193] while the _Oxford English Dictionary_ lists only _films noirs_.[194]

2.  _His Kind of Woman_ was originally directed by John Farrow, then largely reshot under Richard Fleischer after studio owner Howard Hughes demanded rewrites. Only Farrow was credited.[195]

3.  In _Academic Dictionary of Arts_ (2005), Rakesh Chopra notes that the high-contrast film lighting schemes commonly referred to as "chiaroscuro" are more specifically representative of tenebrism, whose first great exponent was the Italian painter Caravaggio (p. 73). See also Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 16.

[158] Silver and Ward (1992) list 315 classic film noirs (passim), and Tuska (1984) lists 320 (passim). Later works are much more inclusive: Paul Duncan, _The Pocket Essential Film Noir_ (2003), lists 647 (pp. 46–84). The title of Michael F. Keaney's _Film Noir Guide: 745 Films of the Classic Era, 1940–1959_ (2003) is self-explanatory.

[159] Treated as noir: Ballinger and Graydon (2007), p. 34; Hirsch (2001), pp. 59, 163–64, 168. Excluded from canon: Silver and Ward (1992), p. 330. Ignored: Bould (2005); Christopher (1998); Ottoson (1981).

[160] Included: Bould (2005), p. 126; Ottoson (1981), p. 174. Ignored: Ballinger and Graydon (2007); Hirsch (2001); Christopher (1998). Also see Silver and Ward (1992): ignored in 1980; included in 1988 (pp. 392, 396).

Christopher (1998) and Silver and Ward (1992), for instance, include _Slightly Scarlet_ and _Party Girl_, but not _Vertigo_, in their filmographies. By contrast, Hirsch (2001) describes _Vertigo_ as among those Hitchcock films that are "richly, demonstrably _noir_" (p. 139) and ignores both _Slightly Scarlet_ and _Party Girl_; Bould (2005) similarly includes _Vertigo_ in his filmography, but not the other two. Ottoson (1981) includes none of the three in his canon.
