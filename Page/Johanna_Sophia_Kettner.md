JOHANNA SOPHIA KETTNER (1724 - 22 February 1802), was an Austrian soldier.

She born in Eichstätt, Franconia, in 1724.[1] In 1743, she enlisted in the imperial Austrian army in the guise of a man named Johann Kettner. She served in the prestigious Hagenbach infantry regiment of the Austrian army for about fourteen years. During her service, she was promoted to the rank of corporal.[2] As such, she was most likely the first of her gender in Austria, as this post was not legally available for women.

In 1748, while undergoing treatment for severe illness, she was discovered to be female and was discharged from the army with honours. Empress Maria Theresa granted her a lifelong pension as a corporal. Johanna Kettner died on 22 February 1802 in the St. Eucharius abbey of Eichstätt.[3]

Kettner became known in history for her achievement which was unique for a woman in the Austrian army at the time.
