ELA ORLEANS (born 1971 in Oświęcim,[1] commonly known by its German name of Auschwitz) is a Polish composer, multi-instrumentalist and singer.[2] Orleans uses electronic and acoustic instruments (including synthesisers, guitar, violin, piano) to create a diverse and layered music. She performs as both a musician and DJ (the latter often under the alias Tract). Her work as a songwriter in many instances uses 1950s and 1960s pop as its basis, by way of everything from electronica to _Éthiopiques_ (the CD series of 1960s and 1970s Ethiopian music), from Polish folk to Bernard Herrmann's film scores for Alfred Hitchcock.

Orleans is based in Glasgow, after years in New York and Warsaw.[3] Various independent labels around the world since 2008 have released her solo studio albums, as well as compilations, mixes and collaborations with artists such as Dirty Beaches, U.S. Girls[4] and The Pastels.[5] Orleans has scored music for TV, film, and opera. She has toured and made festival appearances across the UK, Europe and North America. She has played live and had her work presented internationally in galleries such as Tate Britain.[6]

Orleans describes her music as "movies for ears".[7] She consistently receives international acclaim from the fringe, art and mainstream worlds. _Q_ magazine acknowledges Ela Orleans' "prolific track record on the fringes of experimental music, both as a sound collagist and film composer" (May 2015).[8] _Uncut_ magazine has lauded Ela Orleans for her "beautifully confusing solo albums" (October 2013).[9] _The Wire_ magazine asserted that Orleans' "spectral pop enchants and disturbs, revealing new secrets with each listen" (September 2016).[10] Thurston Moore in the _Mojo_ magazine review of 2014 remarked on Ela Orleans' "astounding soundscapes, though it's her beautiful voice that really galvanises the music. … The best thing I've heard all year."[11] Other noted supporters of Orleans' music include DJ Andrew Weatherall,[12] singer-songwriter Tim Burgess, director David Lynch,[13] author Ian Rankin[14] and indie group The Pastels.[15]


Life and career

Ela Orleans graduated from the National College of Fine Arts in Bielsko-Biala, Poland, in 1991. She completed her master's degree at the Aleksander Zelwerowicz National Academy of Dramatic Art in Warsaw, in 1997. That same year, Orleans moved to Glasgow and, under the name Lizzy Swimmers, joined collage-pop group Hassle Hound.[16]

Ela Orleans returned to Warsaw in 2000. She continued to work with Hassle Hound, collaborated with German composer Marcus Schmickler and also began to create solo material.[17] The UK indie Pickled Egg Records released _Scaring the Grass in the Garden_, the debut album from Hassle Hound, in 2002. The next year, experimental French label Textile Records released a split EP with Hassle Hound and the Australian duo Sun, comprising multi-instrumentalist Oren Ambarchi and composer Chris Townsend.[18]

Orleans moved to New York in 2004, where she played with experimental group Jackie-O Motherfucker, jazz drummer Kevin Shea, and collaborated with various noise artists.[19] Twisted Nerve, the label founded by indie singer-songwriter Badly Drawn Boy and musician-DJ Andy Votel, that year issued "Appalachian Listening Post", a Hassle Hound single, and in 2006 the electronic music label Staubgold put out their second album, _Limelight Cordial_. Hassle Hound split up in 2008, and Orleans began to release her solo work. Italian indie Setola Di Maiale issued the debut Ela Orleans album, _Low Sun, High Moon_, and in 2009 France's La Station Radar put out the vinyl release _Lost_. This year also saw Ela Orleans win two mentorships. Orleans worked under the aegis of composer David Shire, known for soundtracks including _The Taking of Pelham One Two Three_, Francis Ford Coppola's _The Conversation_, and _All the President's Men_, after Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI), the United States performing rights organisation, chose her for its film scoring mentorship program.[20] The New York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA) in addition paired Orleans with Viennese composer Lukas Ligeti after it selected her for its Immigrant Artist Mentoring Program.[21] Ela Orleans began an ongoing collaboration in 2010 as composer for TVP1 and TVP Kultura, respectively the prime and arts channels of Poland's largest television network. A further Hassle Hound album, _Born in a Night_, also appeared this year.

_Double Feature_, a split album with electro-rockabilly artist Dirty Beaches (real name Alex Zhang Hungtai), came out in 2011 (on Night People in the US and La Station Radar in France), as did the third full Ela Orleans album, _Mars Is Heaven_ (jointly released by the French labels La Station Radar and Atelier Ciseaux), and _NEO PI-R_, a compilation of four-track recordings on Clan Destine Records. The Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA) included the Ela Orleans piece "Amsler Grid" in its exhibition _An Exchange with Sol LeWitt_,[22] a celebration of the conceptual artist LeWitt's creative relationships. This year also saw Orleans move back to Glasgow,[23] and the next saw the release of _Statement_, a split album with Dirty Beaches, art-rock performer Slim Twig (real name Max Turnbull) and the indie-electronica group based around Meghan Remy, U.S. Girls. Orleans in addition released _80 Minutes of Funk_ in 2012, a split cassette with Curt Crackrach (née Dafydd McKaharay, a fellow proponent of the so-called "witch house" or horror-film/occult electronica music genre). Orleans also collaborated on several occasions with Skitter (real name Liam Stefani and described by Rough Trade as a "one-man noise puzzlist"[24]) on drone soundscapes, which culminated in 2013's _De fléchettes_. The song "Light in Extension", released under the name Tract, an experimental acid-techno alter ego of Ela Orleans, appeared on the Clan Destine compilation _Dark Acid III_. Ela Orleans' double album _Tumult in Clouds_ meanwhile beat nominees including Hookworms, Broadcast and My Bloody Valentine to win the Mercury Prize alternative, the inaugural Dead Albatross Music Prize.[25]

Orleans remixed "Kalimba" (originally from the Brian Eno album _Music for Films III_ on the All Saints label) by ambient musician Laraaji in 2014, as part of a Warp Records project to revive the All Saints catalogue.[26] Swedish director-artist Maja Borg together with Dazed & Confused, meanwhile, produced Borg's short film _We the Others_ and commissioned Orleans to provide the soundtrack.[27] Orleans also took up residency at the École nationale supérieure d'art de Bourges, France, to score a soundtrack for _Architecture of an Atom_, a feature film directed by cartoonist-filmmaker Juliacks (real name Julia Stein) and screened in various international contemporary art museums.[28] Orleans undertook a further residency at the Warsaw Chamber Opera theatre to compose the music for _Wieza_ (_Tower_), an opera directed by artist Karolina Bregula and commissioned by the Polish foundation Witryna Kultury.[29]

Howie B (full name Howard Bernstein) produced the next Ela Orleans album, _Upper Hell_, and released it on his HB Records label in 2015.[30] Orleans also accepted a commission from the Glasgow Women's Library to score the feature-length documentary _March_, by Royal Conservatoire of Scotland lecturer Anna Birch and editor Marissa Keating.[31] Orleans subsequently took an artist-in-residence position at the Elektronmusikstudion (EMS, or Electroacoustic Music in Sweden), the national centre for Swedish electroacoustic music and sound-art based in Stockholm, to complete a commission for the soundtrack to _Man_, another Maja Borg film.[32] Bristol band Spectres released a duet between frontman Joe Hatt and Ela Orleans, "Spectre", as an unofficial theme song for the James Bond film _Spectre_ and rival to "Writing's on the Wall" by Sam Smith.[33]

The Glasgow Film Festival appointed Ela Orleans in 2016 to write and perform a score for the 1929 silent film _Lucky Star_, directed by Frank Borzage.[34] The Glasgow International Festival in turn commissioned Orleans to write a score for the classic 1932 film _Vampyr_, directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer.[35] The original, unexpurgated vision of _Upper Hell_ appeared as the double album _Circles of Upper and Lower Hell_ (on Glasgow's Night School Records), and Orleans was again nominated for the Dead Albatross Music Prize.[36] The album featured lyrics taken from Arthur Rimbaud, Dante's _Divine Comedy_ and an early 20th-century poem by Sara Teasdale. Stephen Pastel (Stephen McRobbie) and Katrina Mitchell of The Pastels contributed vocals to the song "You Go Through Me".[37]
