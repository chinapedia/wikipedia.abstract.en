MURDOCH PATERSON (September 1826 – 9 August 1898[1]) was an engineer and architect based in Inverness who was chief engineer of the Highland Railway.


Background

He was born in September 1826, one of five sons of Donald Paterson (1778-1851), farmer, at Dell of Inshes, Inverness, and Elizabeth Munro(1789–1847).

He was educated at Inverness Royal Academy, and initially worked as a wine merchant in Inverness.[2]

His elder brother, William Paterson, was also an engineer.[3]

He married firstly Jane MacCallum (1826 - 1868) in January 1852. They had two children:

-   Elizabeth Paterson (1853 - 1933)
-   Donald Paterson (1854 - 1885).

He married secondly Frances Wiles (1837 - 1906) in London in 1870 and they also had two children:

Career

In 1846 he became articled to Joseph Mitchell, the Inspector of Highland Roads and Bridges, and surveyor of railways in the Highlands. In 1851 he worked on expanding the Port of Inverness, and from 1854 worked with Joseph Mitchell on the construction of new lines for the Highland Railway, including Inverness to Keith.

In 1862, Joseph Mitchell set up a partnership with William and Murdoch Paterson, as _Joseph Mitchell and Company_. Mitchell retired in 1867, and Murdoch became chief engineer of the Highland Railway on 6 November 1874.[5]

As well as engineering the construction of new lines for the Highland Railway, he also prepared the designs of many new stations.
