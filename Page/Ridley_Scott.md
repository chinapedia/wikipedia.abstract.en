SIR RIDLEY SCOTT (born 30 November 1937)[1] is an English filmmaker. Following his commercial breakthrough in 1979 with the science fiction horror film _Alien_, further works include the neo-noir dystopian film _Blade Runner_, the road adventure film _Thelma & Louise_, the historical drama _Gladiator_ (which won the Academy Award for Best Picture) and the science fiction film _The Martian_.

Beginning his career in advertising where he honed his filmmaking skills by making inventive mini-films for television commercials, Scott's work is known for its atmospheric, highly concentrated visual style.[2][3][4] Though his films range widely in setting and period, they frequently showcase memorable imagery of urban environments, whether 2nd-century Rome (_Gladiator_), 12th-century Jerusalem (_Kingdom of Heaven_), Medieval England (_Robin Hood_), contemporary Mogadishu (_Black Hawk Down_), the future cityscapes of _Blade Runner_, or the distant planets in _Alien_, _Prometheus_, _The Martian_ and _Alien: Covenant_. Several of his films are also known for their strong female characters.[5]

Scott has been nominated for three Academy Awards for Directing (for _Thelma & Louise_, _Gladiator_ and _Black Hawk Down_).[6] In 1995, both Ridley and his brother Tony received a BAFTA for Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema.[7] In 2003, Scott was knighted for his "services to the British film industry".[8] In a 2004 BBC poll, Scott was named the tenth most influential person in British culture.[9] In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate from the Royal College of Art in London, and in 2018 received the BAFTA Fellowship for lifetime achievement.[10]


Early life and career

Scott was born in South Shields, County Durham to Elizabeth (née Williams) and Colonel Francis Percy Scott.[11][12] Scott's great uncle Dixon Scott was a pioneer of the cinema chain; opening cinemas around Tyneside. One of Dixon's cinemas, Tyneside cinema, is still operating in Newcastle.[13] It is also the last remaining open newsreel cinema operating in the United Kingdom. Ridley Scott was born shortly before the Second World War, he was brought up in an army family. His father – an officer in the Royal Engineers – was absent for most of his early life. His elder brother, Frank, joined the British Merchant Navy when he was still young, and the pair had little contact.[14] During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas) Cumberland in North West England, Wales and Germany. He had a younger brother, Tony, who also became a film director. After World War II, the Scott family moved back to their native North East, eventually settling on Greens Beck Road in Hartburn, County Durham, whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes in _Blade Runner_.[15] His interest in science fiction began by reading the novels of H. G. Wells as a child.[16] He was also influenced by films: "The science-fiction films I saw around then were things like _It!_, _Them!_ and _The Day the Earth Stood Still_. They kind of got me going a little but nothing ever really caught my attention until I saw Stanley Kubrick’s _2001: A Space Odyssey_. Once I saw that I knew what I could do."[17] He studied at Grangefield Grammar School and West Hartlepool College of Art from 1954 to 1958, obtaining a diploma in design.[18]

Scott went on to study at the Royal College of Art in London, contributing to college magazine _ARK_ and helping to establish the college film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film, _Boy and Bicycle_, starring both his younger brother and his father (the film was later released on the "Extras" section of _The Duellists_ DVD). In February 1963 Scott was named in title credits as "Designer" for the BBC television programme _Tonight_, about the severe winter of 1963. After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series _Z-Cars_ and science fiction series _Out of the Unknown_. He was originally assigned to design the second _Doctor Who_ serial, _The Daleks_, which would have entailed realising the serial's eponymous alien creatures. However, shortly before Scott was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant he was replaced by Raymond Cusick.[19] In 1965, he began directing episodes of television series for the BBC, only one of which, an episode of _Adam Adamant Lives!_, is available commercially.[20]

Gold_Hill,_Shaftsbury,_Dorset,_England.JPG in the English county of Dorset where Scott filmed the 1973 Hovis television commercial]] In 1968, Ridley and Tony Scott founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company.[21] Working alongside Alan Parker, Hugh Hudson and cinematographer Hugh Johnson, Ridley Scott made many commercials at RSA during the 1970s, including a 1973 Hovis bread advertisement, "Bike Round" (underscored by the slow movement of Dvořák's "New World" symphony rearranged for brass), set in the north of England but filmed in Gold Hill, Shaftesbury, Dorset.[22][23] A nostalgia themed television advert that captured the public imagination, it was voted the UK's favourite commercial in a 2006 poll.[24][25] In the 1970s the Chanel No. 5 brand needed revitalisation having run the risk of being labelled as mass market and passé.[26] Directed by Scott in the 1970s and 1980s, Chanel television commercials were inventive mini-films with production values of surreal fantasy and seduction, which "played on the same visual imagery, with the same silhouette of the bottle."[27]

Five members of the Scott family are directors, and all have worked for RSA.[28] His brother Tony was a successful film director whose career spanned more than two decades; his sons Jake and Luke are both acclaimed directors of commercials, as is his daughter, Jordan Scott. Jake and Jordan both work from Los Angeles; Luke is based in London. In 1995, Shepperton Studios was purchased by a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, which extensively renovated the studios while also expanding and improving its grounds.[29]


Early films

_The Duellists_

_The Duellists_ (1977) marked Ridley Scott's first feature film as director. Shot in Europe, it was nominated for the main prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and won an award for Best Debut Film. _The Duellists_ had limited commercial impact internationally. Set during the Napoleonic Wars, it follows two French Hussar officers, D'Hubert and Feraud (Keith Carradine and Harvey Keitel) whose quarrel over an initially minor incident turns into a bitter extended feud spanning fifteen years, interwoven with the larger conflict that provides its backdrop. The film has been acclaimed for providing a historically authentic portrayal of Napoleonic uniforms and military conduct.[30][31] The 2013 release of the film on Blu-ray coincided with the publication of an essay on the film in a collection of scholarly essays on Scott.[32]

_Alien_

Scott had originally planned next to adapt a version of _Tristan and Iseult_, but after seeing _Star Wars_, he became convinced of the potential of large scale, effects-driven films. He accepted the job of directing _Alien_, the 1979 horror/science-fiction film that would win him international success. Scott made the decision to switch Ellen Ripley from the standard male action hero to a heroine.[33] Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver), who appeared in the first four _Alien_ films, would become a cinematic icon.[34] The final scene of John Hurt's character has been named by a number of publications as one of the most memorable in cinematic history.Sources that refer to the final scene of Hurt's character in _Alien_ as one of the most memorable in cinematic history include these:

-   -   -   Filmed at Shepperton Studios in England, _Alien_ was the sixth highest-grossing film of 1979, earning over $104 million worldwide.[35] Scott was involved in the 2003 restoration and re-release of the original film. In promotional interviews at the time, Scott indicated he had been in discussions to make a fifth film in the _Alien_ franchise. However, in a 2006 interview, Scott remarked that he had been unhappy about _Alien: The Director's Cut_, feeling that the original was "pretty flawless" and that the additions were merely a marketing tool.[36] Scott later returned to _Alien_-related projects when he directed _Prometheus_ and _Alien: Covenant_ three decades after the original film's release.[37]

_Blade Runner_

After a year working on the film adaptation of _Dune_, and following the sudden death of his brother Frank, Scott signed to direct the film version of Philip K. Dick's novel _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_ Re-titled _Blade Runner_ and starring Harrison Ford, the film was a commercial disappointment in cinemas in 1982, but is now regarded as a classic.[38][39] In 1991, Scott's notes were used by Warner Brothers to create a rushed director's cut which removed the main character's voiceover and made a number of other small changes, including to the ending. Later Scott personally supervised a digital restoration of _Blade Runner_ and approved what was called _The Final Cut_. This version was released in Los Angeles, New York City and Toronto cinemas on 5 October 2007, and as an elaborate DVD release in December 2007.[40]

Today, _Blade Runner_ is ranked by many critics as one of the most important and influential science fiction films ever made,[41] partly thanks to its much imitated portraits of a future cityscape.[42] It is often discussed along with William Gibson's novel _Neuromancer_ as initiating the cyberpunk genre. Scott has described _Blade Runner_ as his "most complete and personal film".[43]

"1984" Apple Macintosh commercial

In 1984, Scott directed a big-budget ($900,000) television commercial, "1984", to launch Apple's Macintosh computer.[44] Scott filmed the advertisement in England for about $370,000;[45] which was given a showcase airing in the US on 22 January 1984, during Super Bowl XVIII, alongside screenings in cinemas.[46] Some consider this advertisement a "watershed event" in advertising[47] and a "masterpiece".[48] _Advertising Age_ placed it top of its list of the 50 greatest commercials.[49]

Set in a dystopian future modelled after George Orwell's _Nineteen Eighty-Four_, Scott's advertisement used its heroine (portrayed by English athlete Anya Major) to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by her white tank top adorned with a picture of the Apple Macintosh computer) as a means of saving humanity from "conformity" (Big Brother), an allusion to IBM, at that time the dominant force in computing.[50]

_Legend_

In 1985, Scott directed _Legend_, a fantasy film produced by Arnon Milchan. Scott decided to create a "once upon a time" tale set in a world of princesses, unicorns and goblins, filming almost entirely inside the studio. Scott cast Tom Cruise as the film's hero, Jack, Mia Sara as Princess Lili and Tim Curry as the Satan-horned Lord of Darkness.[51] Scott had a forest set built on the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, with trees 60 feet high and trunks 30 feet in diameter.[52] In the final stages of filming, the forest set was destroyed by fire; Jerry Goldsmith's original score was used for European release, but replaced in North America with a score by Tangerine Dream. Rob Bottin provided the film's Academy Award-nominated make-up effects, most notably Curry's red-coloured Satan figure. Though a major commercial failure on release, the film has gone on to become a cult classic. The 2002 Director's Cut restored Goldsmith's original score.[53]


Subsequent films

1987–1992

Scott made _Someone to Watch Over Me_, a romantic thriller starring Tom Berenger and Mimi Rogers in 1987, and _Black Rain_ (1989), a police drama starring Michael Douglas and Andy García, shot partially in Japan. Both achieved mild success at the box office. _Black Rain_ was the first of Scott's six collaborations with the composer Hans Zimmer.[54][55]

The road film _Thelma & Louise_ (1991) starring Geena Davis as Thelma, Susan Sarandon as Louise, in addition to the breakthrough role for Brad Pitt as J.D, proved to be one of Scott's biggest critical successes, helping revive the director's reputation and receiving his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director.[56][57] His next project, independently-funded historical epic _1492: Conquest of Paradise_, was a box office failure. The film recounts the expeditions to the Americas by Christopher Columbus (French star Gérard Depardieu). Scott did not release another film for four years.

1993–1999

In 1995, Ridley and his brother Tony formed a production company, Scott Free Productions, in Los Angeles. All Ridley's subsequent feature films, starting with _White Squall_ and _G.I. Jane_, have been produced under the Scott Free banner. In 1995 the two brothers purchased a controlling interest in the British film studio Shepperton Studios. In 2001, Shepperton merged with Pinewood Studios to become The Pinewood Studios Group, which is headquartered in Buckinghamshire, England.[58]

2000–2005

Scott's historical drama _Gladiator_ (2000) proved to be one of his biggest critical and commercial successes. It won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for the film's star Russell Crowe, and saw Scott nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director.[59] Scott worked with British visual effects company The Mill for the film's computer-generated imagery, and the film was dedicated to Oliver Reed who died during filming – The Mill created a digital body double for Reed's remaining scenes.[60][61] Some have credited ''Gladiator '' with reviving the nearly defunct "sword and sandal" historical genre. The film was named the fifth best action film of all time in the ABC special _Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time_.[62]

Scott directed _Hannibal_ (2001) starring Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. The film was commercially successful despite receiving mixed reviews. Scott's next film, _Black Hawk Down_ (2001), featuring Tom Hardy in his film debut, was based on a group of stranded US soldiers fighting for their lives in Somalia; Scott was nominated for an Oscar for Best Director.[63] In 2003, Scott directed a smaller scale project, _Matchstick Men_, adapted from the novel by Eric Garcia and starring Nicolas Cage, Sam Rockwell and Alison Lohman. It received mostly positive reviews, but performed moderately at the box office.

In 2005, he made the modestly successful _Kingdom of Heaven_, a film about the Crusades. The film starred Orlando Bloom, and marked Scott's first collaboration with the composer Harry Gregson-Williams.[64] The Moroccan government sent the Moroccan cavalry as extras for some battle scenes.[65] Unhappy with the theatrical version of _Kingdom of Heaven_ (which he blamed on paying too much attention to the opinions of preview audiences in addition to relenting when Fox wanted 45 minutes shaved off), Scott supervised a director's cut of the film, the true version of what he wanted, which was released on DVD in 2006.[66] The director's cut of _Kingdom of Heaven_ has been met with critical acclaim, with _Empire_ magazine calling the film an "epic", adding: "The added 45 minutes in the director’s cut are like pieces missing from a beautiful but incomplete puzzle."[67] "This is the one that should have gone out" reflected Scott.[68] Asked if he was against previewing in general in 2006, Scott stated: "It depends who's in the driving seat. If you've got a lunatic doing my job, then you need to preview. But a good director should be experienced enough to judge what he thinks is the correct version to go out into the cinema."[69]


Recent and upcoming films

2006–2011

Scott teamed up again with _Gladiator_ star Russell Crowe, for _A Good Year_, based on the best-selling book by Peter Mayle about an investment banker who finds a new life in Provence. The film was released on 10 November 2006. A few days later Rupert Murdoch, chairman of studio 20th Century Fox (who backed the film) dismissed _A Good Year_ as "a flop" at a shareholders' meeting.[70]

Scott's next film was _American Gangster_, based on the story of real-life drug kingpin Frank Lucas. Scott took over the project in early 2006, and had screenwriter Steven Zaillian rewrite his script to focus on the dynamic between Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts. Denzel Washington signed on to the project as Lucas, with Russell Crowe co-starring. The film premiered in November 2007 to positive reviews and box office success, and Scott was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Director.[71]

In late 2008, Scott's espionage thriller _Body of Lies_, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, opened to lukewarm ticket-sales and mixed reviews. Scott directed a revisionist adaptation of _Robin Hood_, which starred Russell Crowe as Robin Hood and Cate Blanchett as Maid Marian. It was released in May 2010 to mixed reviews, but a respectable box-office.

On 31 July 2009, news surfaced of a two-part prequel to _Alien_ with Scott attached to direct.[72][73] The project, ultimately reduced to a single film called _Prometheus_, which Scott described as sharing "strands of _Alien_'s DNA" while not being a direct prequel, was released in June 2012. The film starred Charlize Theron and Michael Fassbender, with Noomi Rapace playing the leading role of the scientist named Elizabeth Shaw. The film received mostly positive reviews and grossed $403 million at the box office.[74][75]

In August 2009, Scott planned to direct an adaptation of Aldous Huxley's _Brave New World_ set in a dystopian London with Leonardo DiCaprio.[76] In 2009, the TV series _The Good Wife_ premiered with Ridley and his brother Tony credited as executive producers. On 6 July 2010, YouTube announced the launch of _Life in a Day_, an experimental documentary executive produced by Scott. Released at the Sundance Film Festival on 27 January 2011, it incorporates footage shot on 24 July 2010 submitted by YouTube users from around the world.[77] As part of the buildup to the 2012 London Olympics, Scott produced _Britain in a Day_, a documentary film consisting of footage shot by the British public on 12 November 2011.[78]

2012–present

In 2012, Scott produced the commercial for Lady Gaga's fragrance, "Fame." It was touted as the first ever black Eau de Parfum, in the informal credits attached to the trailer for this advertisement. On 24 June 2013, Scott's series _Crimes of the Century_ debuted on CNN.[79] In November 2012 it was announced that Scott would produce the documentary, _Springsteen & I_ directed by Baillie Walsh and inspired by _Life in a Day_, which Scott also produced. The film featured fan footage from throughout the world on what musician Bruce Springsteen meant to them and how he impacted their lives.[80] The film was released for one day only in 50 countries and on over 2000 film screens on 22 July 2013.[81]

Scott directed _The Counselor_ (2013), with a screenplay by author Cormac McCarthy.[82][83] On 25 October 2013, _Indiewire_ reported that "Before McCarthy sold his first spec script for Scott's (_The Counselor_) film, the director was heavily involved in developing an adaptation of the author's 1985 novel _Blood Meridian_ with screenwriter Bill Monahan (_The Departed_). But as Scott said in a _Time Out_ interview, '[Studios] didn't want to make it. The book is so uncompromising, which is what's great about it.' Described as an 'anti-western'..."[84] Scott directed the biblically-inspired epic film _Exodus: Gods and Kings_, released in December 2014 which received negative reviews from critics and grossed $268 million on a $140 million budget making it as a box office disappointment. Filmed at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, the film starred Christian Bale in the lead role.[85]

NASA_Journey_to_Mars_and_“The_Martian"_(201508180003HQ).jpg'', 18 August 2015]] In May 2014, Scott began negotiations to direct _The Martian_, starring Matt Damon as Mark Watney.[86] Like many of Scott's previous works, _The Martian_ features a heroine in the form of Jessica Chastain's character who is the mission commander.[87] The film was originally scheduled for release on 25 November 2015, but Fox later switched its release date with that of _Victor Frankenstein_, and thus _The Martian_ was released on 2 October 2015.[88][89] _The Martian_ was a critical and commercial success, grossed over $630 million worldwide, becoming Scott's highest-grossing film to date.[90][91][92]

A sequel to _Prometheus_, _Alien: Covenant_, started filming in 2016, premiered in London on 4 May 2017, and received general release on 19 May 2017.[93] The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising Michael Fassbender's dual performance and calling the film a return to form for both director Ridley Scott and the franchise.[94][95]

In August 2011, information leaked about production of a sequel to _Blade Runner_ by Alcon Entertainment, with Alcon partners Broderick Johnson and Andrew Kosove.[96] Scott informed the _Variety_ publication in November 2014 that he was no longer the director for the film and would only fulfill a producer's role. Scott also revealed that filming would begin sometime within 2015, and that Harrison Ford has signed on to reprise his role from the original film but his character should only appear in "the third act" of the sequel.[97] On 26 February 2015, the sequel was officially confirmed, with Denis Villeneuve hired to direct the film, and Scott being an executive producer.[98] The sequel, _Blade Runner 2049_, was released on 6 October 2017.[99]

From May to August 2017, Scott filmed _All the Money in the World,_ a drama about the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III, starring Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams.[100][101] Kevin Spacey originally portrayed Getty Sr. However, after multiple sexual assault allegations against the actor, Scott made the decision to replace him with Christopher Plummer, saying "You can't condone that kind of behaviour in any shape or form. We cannot let one person's action affect the good work of all these other people. It's that simple."[102] Scott began re-shooting Spacey's scenes with Plummer on 20 November, which included filming at Elveden Hall in west Suffolk, England.[103] With a release date of 25 December 2017, the film studio had its doubts that Scott would manage it, saying: "They were like, 'You'll never do it. God be with you.'"[104][105]

Future projects

In January 2016, Scott was in early negotiations to direct the film version of the 1968 British TV series _The Prisoner_.[106] In May 2016, it was announced that Scott and Drew Goddard (who had worked together on _The Martian_) would be reteaming to adapt the book _Wraiths of the Broken Land_ by S. Craig Zahler. It is described as a piece of fiction that combines elements of "horror, noir, and Asian ultra-violence."[107] In April 2017, 20th Century Fox lined up Scott to direct a film about the Battle of Britain from WWII, where the Royal Air Force defended the country from German Luftwaffe attacks, which is described as a "passion project" for the director.[108] In January 2018, it was reported that Scott is in talks to direct a Disney film adaptation of _The Merlin Saga_, which is based on a 12-book series written by T. A. Barron, with a screenplay from Philippa Boyens.[109] That same month, Scott stated that he has "another [story] ready to evolve and be developed, [that] there is certainly one to be done for sure", referring to a third _Blade Runner_ film.[110] In March 2018, it was reported that Scott is in talks to adapt Greg Rucka's graphic novel _Queen & Country_ for 20th Century Fox.[111]


Television projects

Ridley Scott and his brother Tony produced CBS series _Numb3rs_ (2005–10), a crime drama about a genius mathematician who helps the FBI solve crimes; and _The Good Wife_ (2009–2016), a legal drama about an attorney balancing her job with her husband, a former state attorney trying to rebuild his political career after a major scandal. The two Scotts also produced a 2010 film adaptation of 1980s television show _The A-Team_, directed by Joe Carnahan.[112][113]

Ridley Scott was an executive producer of the first season of Amazon's _The Man in the High Castle_ (2015–16).[114] Through Scott Free Productions, he is an executive producer on the dark comic science-fiction series _BrainDead_ which debuted on CBS in 2016.[115][116][117]

On 20 November 2017, Amazon struck a deal with AMC Studios for a worldwide release of _The Terror_, Scott's series adaptation of Dan Simmons' novel, a speculative retelling of British explorer Sir John Franklin's lost expedition of HMS _Erebus_ and HMS _Terror_ to the Arctic in 1845–1848 to force the Northwest Passage, with elements of horror and supernatural fiction), and the series premiered in March 2018.[118][119]


Personal life

%27The_Martian%27_World_Premiere_(NHQ201509110014).jpg'' held at the Toronto International Film Festival on 11 September 2015]]

Ridley Scott was married to Felicity Heywood from 1964 to 1975. The couple had two sons, Jake and Luke,[120] both of whom work as directors on Scott's production company, Ridley Scott Associates. Scott later married advertising executive Sandy Watson in 1979, with whom he had a daughter, Jordan Scott, and divorced in 1989.[121] His current partner is actress Giannina Facio,[122] whom he has cast in all his films since _White Squall_ except _American Gangster_ and _The Martian_.[123] He divides his time between homes in London, France, and Los Angeles.[124]

His eldest brother Frank died, aged 45, of skin cancer in 1980.[125] His younger brother Tony, who was also his business partner in their company Scott Free, died on 19 August 2012 at the age of 68 after jumping from the Vincent Thomas Bridge which spans Los Angeles Harbor, after an originally disputed long struggle with cancer.[126] Before Tony's death, he and Ridley collaborated on a miniseries based on Robin Cook's novel, _Coma_ for A&E. The two-part miniseries premiered on A&E on 3 September 2012, to mixed reviews.[127]

Ridley has dedicated several of his films in memory of his family: _Blade Runner_ to his brother Frank, _Black Hawk Down_ to his mother, and _The Counselor_ and _Exodus: Gods and Kings_ to his brother Tony.[128] Ridley also paid tribute to his late brother Tony at the 2016 Golden Globes, after his film, _The Martian_, won Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.[129]

In 2013, Ridley stated that he is an atheist.[130] Although when asked by the BBC in a September 2014 interview if he believes in God, Scott replied:


Approach and style

Appearing in the lead role in Scott's _Gladiator_ and _Robin Hood_, Russell Crowe commented, "I like being on Ridley's set because actors can perform [...] and the focus is on the performers."[131] Paul M. Sammon, in his book _Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner_, commented in an interview with Brmovie.com that Scott's relationship with his actors has improved considerably over the years.[132] More recently during the filming of Scott's 2012 film, _Prometheus_, Charlize Theron praised the director's willingness to listen to suggestions from the cast for improvements in the way their characters are portrayed on screen. Theron worked alongside the writers and Scott to give more depth to her character during filming.[133]

Scott's work is identified for its striking visuals, with heroines also a common theme.[134][135][136][137] His visual style, incorporating a detailed approach to production design and innovative, atmospheric lighting, has been influential on a subsequent generation of filmmakers.[138][139] Scott commonly uses slow pacing until the action sequences. Examples include _Alien_ and _Blade Runner_; the _LA Times_ critic Sheila Benson, for example, would call the latter "Blade Crawler" "because it's so damn slow". Another technique he employs is use of sound or music to build tension, as heard in _Alien_, with hissing steam, beeping computers and the noise of the machinery in the space ship. Scott claims to have an eidetic memory, which he says aids him in visualising and storyboarding the scenes in his films.[140]

Scott has developed a method for filming intricate shots as swiftly as possible: "I like working, always, with a minimum of three cameras. [...] So those 50 set-ups [a day] might only be 25 set-ups except I'm covering in the set-up. So you're finished. I mean, if you take a little bit more time to prep on three cameras, or if it's a big stunt, eleven cameras, and – whilst it may take 45 minutes to set up – then when you're ready you say 'Action!', and you do three takes, two takes and is everybody happy? You say, 'Yeah, that's it.' So you move on."[141]

Artificial intelligence is a unifying theme throughout Scott's career as a director, particularly in _Blade Runner_, _Alien_, and _Prometheus_.[142] The recent book _The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott_ identifies Alan Turing and John Searle, a professor at the University of California, as presenting relevant models of testing artificial intelligence known as the Turing test and the Chinese Room Thought Experiment, respectively, in the chapter titled "What's Wrong with Building Replicants," which has been a recurring theme for many of Scott's films.[143] The chapter titled "Artificial Intelligence in _Blade Runner_, _Alien_, and _Prometheus_," concludes by citing the writings of John Stuart Mill in the context of Scott's Nexus-6 Replicants in _Blade Runner_ (Rutger Hauer), the android Ash (Ian Holm) in _Alien_, and the android David 8 (Michael Fassbender) in _Prometheus_, where Mill is applied to assert that measures and tests of intelligence must also assess actions and moral behaviour in androids to effectively address the themes which Scott explores in these films.[144]


DVD format and Director's Cut

Scott is known for his enthusiasm for the DVD format, providing audio commentaries and interviews for all his films where possible. In the July 2006 issue of _Total Film_ magazine, he stated: "After all the work we go through, to have it run in the cinema and then disappear forever is a great pity. To give the film added life is really cool for both those who missed it and those who really loved it."[145]

Running alongside his enthusiasm for DVD, Scott is known for his use of the director's cut.[146] The positive reaction to the _Blade Runner_ Director's Cut encouraged Scott to re-cut several movies that were a disappointment at the time of their release (including _Legend_ and _Kingdom of Heaven_), which have been met with great acclaim.[147] Today the practice of alternative cuts is more commonplace, though often as a way to make a film stand out in the DVD marketplace by adding new material.

Accolades

Ridley_Scott_at_the_RCA_July_2015.jpg, July 2015]] Scott was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 2003 New Year Honours for services to the British film industry.[152] He received his accolade from Queen Elizabeth II at an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 8 July 2003.[153] Scott admitted feeling "stunned and truly humbled" after the ceremony, saying, "As a boy growing up in South Shields, I could never have imagined that I would receive such a special recognition. I am truly humbled to receive this treasured award and believe it also further recognises the excellence of the British film industry."[154]

He has been nominated for three Academy Awards for Directing—_Thelma & Louise_, _Gladiator_ and _Black Hawk Down_—as well as a Golden Globe, BAFTA and 2 Primetime Emmy Awards. In 1995, Ridley and his brother Tony received the BAFTA for Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema.[155] In 2018 he received the highest accolade from BAFTA, the BAFTA Fellowship, for lifetime achievement.[156]

Scott was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2007.[157] In 2017 the German newspaper _FAZ_ compared Scott's influence on the science fiction film genre to Sir Alfred Hitchcock's on thrillers and John Ford's on Westerns.[158] In 2011, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[159]

In 2012, Scott was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles' _Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band_ album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires to mark his 80th birthday.[160] On 3 July 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Royal College of Art in a ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London at which he described how he still keeps on his office wall his school report placing him 31st out of 31 in his class, and how his teacher encouraged him to pursue what became his passion at art school.[161][162]
