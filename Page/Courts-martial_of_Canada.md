COURTS-MARTIAL IN CANADA are trials conducted by the Canadian Armed Forces. The Chief Military Judge is Colonel Mario Dutil.[1] Such courts martial are authorized under the National Defence Act.[2] Civilians with a military unit also become subject to the courts-martial system.[3]

Most commonly, courts-martial are convened to try members of the Canadian military for criminal violations of the Code of Service Discipline, which is the Canadian military's criminal code.[4][5] The constitutionality of military courts-martial was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in R v Généreux, but changes were mandated to ensure judicial independence.[6] It was also determined that off-duty conduct can also fall under a court martial.[7]

Since 2014, decisions of Canada's courts-martial have been available online.[8]

Decisions of Canadian Courts-Martial can be appealed to the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada, a body made up of civilian judges.
