A CREED (also known as a _confession_, _symbol_, or _statement of faith_) is a statement of the shared beliefs of a religious community in the form of a fixed formula summarizing core tenets.

The earliest creed in Christianity, "Jesus is Lord", originated in the writings of Saint Paul.[1] One of the most widely used creeds in Christianity is the Nicene Creed, first formulated in AD 325 at the First Council of Nicaea. It was based on Christian understanding of the Canonical Gospels, the letters of the New Testament and to a lesser extent the Old Testament. Affirmation of this creed, which describes the Trinity, is generally taken as a fundamental test of orthodoxy for most Christian denominations.[2] The Apostles' Creed is also broadly accepted. Some Christian denominations and other groups have rejected the authority of those creeds.

Muslims declare the _shahada_, or testimony: "I bear witness that there is no god but (the One) God _(Allah)_, and I bear witness that Muhammad is God's messenger."[3]

Whether Judaism is creedal has been a point of some controversy. Although some say Judaism is noncreedal in nature, others say it recognizes a single creed, the _Shema Yisrael_, which begins: "Hear, O Israel: the our God, the is one."[4]


Terminology

The word _creed_ is particularly used for a concise statement which is recited as part of liturgy. The term is anglicized from Latin _credo_ "I believe", the incipit of the Latin texts of the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed. A creed is sometimes referred to as a _symbol_ in a specialized meaning of that word (which was first introduced to Late Middle English in this sense), after Latin _symbolum_ "creed" (as in _Symbolum Apostolorum_ = "Apostles' Creed"), after Greek _symbolon_ "token, watchword".[5]

Some longer statements of faith in the Protestant tradition are instead called "confessions of faith", or simply "confession" (as in e.g. Helvetic Confession). Within Evangelicalism, the terms "doctrinal statement" or "doctrinal basis" tend to be preferred. Doctrinal statements may include positions on lectionary and translations of the Bible, particularly in fundamentalist churches of the King James Only movement.

The term _creed_ is sometimes extended to comparable concepts in non-Christian theologies; thus the Islamic concept of _ʿaqīdah_ (literally "bond, tie") is often rendered as "creed".


Christian creeds

Several creeds have originated in Christianity.

-   1 Corinthians 15, 3–7 includes an early creed about Jesus' death and resurrection which was probably received by Paul. The antiquity of the creed has been located by most biblical scholars to no more than five years after Jesus' death, probably originating from the Jerusalem apostolic community.[6]
-   The Old Roman Creed is an earlier and shorter version of the Apostles' Creed. It was based on the 2nd century Rules of Faith and the interrogatory declaration of faith for those receiving baptism, which by the 4th century was everywhere tripartite in structure, following Matthew 28:19.
-   The Apostles' Creed is widely used by most Christian denominations for both liturgical and catechetical purposes.
-   The Nicene Creed reflects the concerns of the First Council of Nicaea in 325 which had as their chief purpose to establish what Christians believed.[7]
-   The Chalcedonian Creed was adopted at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 in Asia Minor. It defines that Christ is 'acknowledged in two natures', which 'come together into one person and hypostasis'.
-   The Athanasian Creed (_Quicumque vult_) is a Christian statement of belief focusing on Trinitarian doctrine and Christology. It is the first creed in which the equality of the three persons of the Trinity is explicitly stated and differs from the Nicene and Apostles' Creeds in the inclusion of anathemas, or condemnations of those who disagree with the Creed.
-   The Tridentine Creed was initially contained in the papal bull _Iniunctum Nobis_, issued by Pope Pius IV on November 13, 1565. The creed was intended to summarize the teaching of the Council of Trent (1545–1563).
-   The Maasai Creed is a creed composed in 1960 by the Maasai people of East Africa in collaboration with missionaries from the Congregation of the Holy Ghost. The creed attempts to express the essentials of the Christian faith within the Maasai culture.
-   The Credo of the People of God is a profession of faith that Pope Paul VI published with the _motu proprio_ _Solemni hac liturgia_ of 30 June 1968. Pope Paul VI spoke of it as "a profession of faith, ... a creed which, without being strictly speaking a dogmatic definition, repeats in substance, with some developments called for by the spiritual condition of our time, the creed of Nicea, the creed of the immortal tradition of the holy Church of God."


Christian confessions of faith

Protestant denominations are usually associated with confessions of faith, which are similar to creeds but usually longer.

-   The _Sixty-seven Articles_ of the Swiss reformers, drawn up by Zwingli in 1523;
-   The _Schleitheim Confession_ of the Anabaptist Swiss Brethren in 1527;
-   The _Augsburg Confession_ of 1530, the work of Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon, which marked the breach with Rome;
-   The _Tetrapolitan Confession_ of the German Reformed Church, 1530;
-   The _Smalcald Articles_ of Martin Luther, 1537
-   The _Guanabara Confession of Faith_, 1558;
-   The _Gallic Confession_, 1559;
-   The _Scots Confession_, drawn up by John Knox in 1560;
-   The _Belgic Confession_[8] drawn up by Guido de Bres[9] in 1561;
-   The _Thirty-nine Articles_ of the Church of England in 1562;
-   The _Formula of Concord_ and its Epitome in 1577;
-   The _Irish Articles_ in 1615;
-   The Baptist Confession of Faith (1644)
-   The _Westminster Confession of Faith_ in 1647 was the work of the Westminster Assembly of Divines and has commended itself to the Presbyterian Churches of all English-speaking peoples, and also in other languages.
-   The _Savoy Declaration_[10] of 1658 which was a modification of the Westminster Confession to suit Congregationalist polity;
-   The _Baptist Confession_ (1689);
-   The _Confession of Faith of the Calvinistic Methodists (Presbyterians) of Wales_[11] of 1823.
-   The Assemblies of God Statement of Fundamental Truths (1916)
-   The _Confession of Faith_ of the United Methodist Church, adopted in 1968


Christians without creeds

Some Christian denominations, and particularly those descending from the Radical Reformation, do not profess a creed. This stance is often referred to as "non-creedalism". The Religious Society of Friends, also known as the Quakers, consider that they have no need for creedal formulations of faith. The Church of the Brethren and other Schwarzenau Brethren churches also espouses no creed, referring to the New Testament, as their "rule of faith and practice."[12] Jehovah's Witnesses contrast "memorizing or repeating creeds" with acting to "do what Jesus said".[13] Unitarian Universalists do not share a creed.[14]

Many evangelical Protestants similarly reject creeds as definitive statements of faith, even while agreeing with some creeds' substance. The Baptists have been non-creedal "in that they have not sought to establish binding authoritative confessions of faith on one another".[15] While many Baptists are not opposed to the ancient creeds, they regard them as "not so final that they cannot be revised and re-expressed. At best, creeds have a penultimacy about them and, of themselves, could never be the basis of Christian fellowship".[16] Moreover, Baptist "confessions of faith" have often had a clause such as this from the First London (Particular) Baptist Confession (Revised edition, 1646):

Similar reservations about the use of creeds can be found in the Restoration Movement and its descendants, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the Churches of Christ, and the Christian churches and churches of Christ. Restorationists profess "no creed but Christ".[17]

Bishop John Shelby Spong, retired Episcopal Bishop of Newark, has written that dogmas and creeds were merely "a stage in our development" and "part of our religious childhood." In his book, _Sins of the Scripture_, Spong wrote that "Jesus seemed to understand that no one can finally fit the holy God into his or her creeds or doctrines. That is idolatry."[18]

In the Swiss Reformed Churches, there was a quarrel about the Apostles' Creed in the mid-19th century. As a result, most cantonal reformed churches stopped prescribing any particular creed.[19]


Latter Day Saints

Within the sects of the Latter Day Saint movement, the _Articles of Faith_ are a list composed by Joseph Smith as part of an 1842 letter sent to "Long" John Wentworth, editor of the _Chicago Democrat_. It is canonized with the "Bible", the "Book of Mormon", the "Doctrine & Covenants" and _Pearl of Great Price_, as part of the standard works of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Creedal works include:

-   "Address" by Oliver Cowdery (_Messenger and Advocate_ 1(1), October 1834, p. 2)
-   Wentworth letter (1842)
-   Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints) (1880)
-   1890 Manifesto
-   Second Manifesto (1904)
-   1978 Revelation on Priesthood
-   The Family: A Proclamation to the World (1995)
-   The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles (2000)
-   God Loveth His Children (2007)
-   Handbook (LDS Church) (2010) - a work unifying scripture and creed with ecclesiology and polity
-   For the Strength of Youth (2011)


Jewish creed

Whether Judaism is creedal in character has generated some controversy. Rabbi Milton Steinberg wrote that "By its nature Judaism is averse to formal creeds which of necessity limit and restrain thought" and asserted in his book _Basic Judaism_ (1947) that "Judaism has never arrived at a creed." The 1976 Centenary Platform of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, an organization of Reform rabbis, agrees that "Judaism emphasizes action rather than creed as the primary expression of a religious life."

Others, however, characterize the Shema Yisrael as a creedal statement in strict monotheism embodied in a single prayer: "Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One" (; transliterated _Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad_).

A notable statement of Jewish principles of faith was drawn up by Maimonides as his 13 Principles of Faith.[20]


Islamic creed

The shahada, the two-part statement that "There is no god but God; Muhammad is the messenger of God" is often popularly called "the Islamic creed" and its utterance is one of the "five pillars".[21]

In Islamic theology, the term most closely corresponding to "creed" is _ʿaqīdah_ () The first such creed was written as "a short answer to the pressing heresies of the time" is known as _Al-Fiqh Al-Akbar_ and ascribed to Abū Ḥanīfa.[22][23][24] Two well known creeds were the _Fiqh Akbar II_[25] "representative" of the al-Ash'ari, and _Fiqh Akbar III_, "representative" of the Ash-Shafi'i.[26]

_Iman_ () in Islamic theology denotes a believer's religious faith .[27][28] Its most simple definition is the belief in the six articles of faith, known as _arkān al-īmān_.

1.  Belief in God
2.  Belief in the Angels
3.  Belief in Divine Books
4.  Belief in the Prophets
5.  Belief in the Day of Judgment
6.  Belief in God's predestination
