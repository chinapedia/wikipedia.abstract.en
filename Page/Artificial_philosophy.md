ARTIFICIAL PHILOSOPHY is a philosophical branch conceived by author Louis Molnar[1] to consider what a being bestowed with artificial intelligence (AI) might consider about its own existence once it reaches a higher state of consciousness. The author reasons in his dissertation that at some point, either through programming or organic self-development, robots will not see themselves as extensions of those that created them, and that their saying "Who am I?" will not lead them to think of themselves as one with humans.
