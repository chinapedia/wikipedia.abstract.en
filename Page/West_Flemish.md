WEST FLEMISH (, ) is a dialect of the Dutch language spoken in western Belgium and adjoining parts of the Netherlands and France.[1]

West Flemish is spoken by about a million people in the Belgian province of West Flanders, and a further 120,000 in the neighbouring Dutch coastal district of Zeelandic Flanders and 10,000 in the northern part of the French _département_ of Nord.[2] Some of the main cities where West Flemish is widely spoken are Bruges, Dunkirk, Kortrijk, Ostend, Roeselare, Ypres and Newport

West Flemish is listed as a "vulnerable" language in UNESCO's online Red Book of Endangered Languages.[3] The language has its own dedicated Wikipedia.[4] Languages_Benelux.PNG countries]] FlemishinDunkirkdistrict.PNG in France, in 1874 and 1972]]

Phonology

West Flemish has a phonology that differs significantly from that of Standard Dutch. The best known traits are the replacement of Standard Dutch (pre-)velar fricatives _g_ and _ch_ in Dutch () with glottal _h_ and the overall lack of diphthongs. The following differences are listed by their Dutch spelling, as some different letters have merged their sounds in Standard Dutch but remained separate sounds in West Flemish. Pronunciations can also differ slightly from region to region.

-   _sch_ - is realised as , or (_sh_ or _sk_).
-   _ei_ - is realised as or (_è_ or _jè_).
-   ''ij '' - is realised as (short _ie_, also written as _y_) and in some words as .
-   ''ui '' - is realised as (short _ie_, also written as _y_) and in some words as .
-   _au_ - is realised as (_ow_)
-   _ou_ - is realised as (short _oe_), it is very similar to the long "oe" that is also used in Standard Dutch (), which can cause confusion
-   _e_ - is realised as or .
-   _i_ - is realised as .
-   _ie_ - is longer
-   _aa_ - is realised as .

The nonexistentce of and in West Flemish makes pronuncing them very difficult for native speakers. That often causes hypercorrection of the sounds to a or .

Standard Dutch also has many words with an _-en_ () suffix (mostly plural forms of verbs and nouns). While Standard Dutch and most dialects do not pronounce the final _n_, West Flemish typically drops the _e_ and pronounces the _n_ inside the base word. For base words already ending with _n_, the final _n_ sound is often lengthened to clarify the suffix. That makes many words become similar to those of English: _beaten_, _listen_ etc.

The short _o_ () can also be pronounced as a short _u_ (). That happens spontaneously to some words, but other words keep their original short _o_ sounds. Similarly, the short _a_ () can turn into a short _o_ () in some words spontaneously.

The diphthong _ui_ () does not exist in West Flemish and is replaced by a long _u_ () or a long _ie_ (). Like for the _ui_, the long _o_ () can be replaced by an (_eu_) for some words but a for others. That often causes similarities to ranchers English.

Here are some examples showing the sound shifts that are part of the vocabulary:

  Dutch              West Flemish   English
  ------------------ -------------- ---------
  vol (short _o_)    vul            full
  zon (short _o_)    zunne          sun
  kom (short _o_)    kom            come
  boter (long _o_)   beuter         butter
  boot (long _o_)    boot           boat
  kuiken             kiek'n         chicken
  bruin              brun           brown


Grammar

Plural form

Plural forms in Standard Dutch most often add _-en_, but West Flemish usually uses _-s_, like the Lower Saxon Germanic dialects and even more prominently in English in which _-en_ has become very rare. Under the influence of Standard Dutch, _-s_ is being used by fewer people, and younger speakers tend to use _-en_.

Verb conjugation

The verbs _zijn_ ("to be") and _hebben_ ("to have") are also conjugated differently.

  Dutch         West Flemish   English    Dutch           West Flemish   English
  ------------- -------------- ---------- --------------- -------------- -----------
  zijn          zyn            to be      hebben          èn             to have
  ik ben        'k zyn         I am       ik heb          'k è           I have
  jij bent      gy zyt         you are    jij hebt        gy èt          you have
  hij is        ie is          he is      hij heeft       ie èt          he has
  wij zijn      wydder zyn     we are     wij hebben      wydder èn      we have
  jullie zijn   gydder zyt     you are    jullie hebben   gydder èt      you have
  zij zijn      zydder zyn     they are   zij hebben      zydder èn      they have

Double subject

West Flemish often has a double subject.

  Dutch                     West Flemish                English
  ------------------------- --------------------------- ---------------------
  Jij hebt dat gedaan.      G' è GY da gedoan.          You have done that.
  Ik heb dat niet gedaan.   'K èn EKIK da nie gedoan.   I didn't do that.

Articles

Standard Dutch has an indefinite article that does not depend on gender, unlike in West Flemish. However, a gender-independent article is increasingly used. Like in English, _n_ is pronounced only if the next word begins with a vowel sound.

  Dutch           West Flemish   English
  --------------- -------------- ---------
  een stier (m)   ne stier       a bull
  een koe (f)     e koe          a cow
  een kalf (o)    e kolf         a calf
  een aap (m)     nen oap        an ape
  een huis (o)    en 'us         a house

Conjugation of _yes_ and _no_

Another feature of West Flemish is the conjugation of _ja_ and _nee_ ("yes" and "no") to the subject of the sentence. That is somewhat related to the double subject, but even when the rest of the sentence is not pronounced, _ja_ and _nee_ are generally used with the first part of the double subject. There is also an extra word, _toet_ (), negates the previous sentence but gives a positive answer.

_Ja_, _nee_ and _toet_ can also all be strengthened by adding _mo-_ or _ba-_. Both mean "but" and are derived from Dutch _but_ or _maar_) and can be even used together (_mobatoet_).

  Dutch                                       West Flemish                      English
  ------------------------------------------- --------------------------------- ------------------------------------------
  Heb jij dat gedaan? - Ja / Nee              Èj gy da gedoan? - Joak / Nink    Did you do that? - Yes / No
  Je hebt dat niet gedaan, hé? - Maar jawel   G'èt da nie gedoan, é? - Batoet   You didn't do that, eh? - But yes I did.
  Heeft hij dat gedaan? - Ja / Nee            Èt ie da gedoan? - Joaj / Nij     Did he do that? - Yes / No
  Gaan we verder? - Ja / Nee                  Zyn we? - Jow / Niw               Can we go? - Yes / No


Vocabulary

West Flemish inherited many words from Saxon settlers and later on had English loanwords from the wool and cloth trades. Both categories differ from Standard Dutch and show similarities with English and so is difficult to separate both categories.

During the Industrial Revolution, the increasing trade with France caused many industrial loanwords from French.

False friends

Even when words exist in both Dutch and West Flemish, their meaning can be different. That sometimes causes confusion for native speakers who do not realise that words are used differently.

  Dutch    West Flemish   English
  -------- -------------- ------------------------------------
  achter   bachtn         after / behind (a notion of space)
  na       achter         past / after (a notion of time)
