Clarendon_Crescent,_Edinburgh.JPG 17_Rutland_Square,_Edinburgh.jpg Parishchurchpolmont.jpg Eton_Terrace_(2412381693).jpg JOHN TAIT (1787-1856) was a Scottish architect operating in the first half of the 19th century responsible for several fine streets in Edinburgh all of which are listed buildings. One of his creations, 15 Rutland Square, houses the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland.[1]


Life

He is believed to have been born in Edinburgh in 1787. His early years are unclear but he is thought to have apprenticed as an architect under Archibald Elliot as several of his works conclude Elliotâ€™s works.

He first appears listed in Edinburgh directories as an architect in 1826, living at 1 Mound Place in the Old Town.[2] He worked for the Provost, John Learmonth in feuing the Learmonth area of the city, north of Dean Village, and continued in this role even after John Learmonth was forced to pass the project on to the Heriot Trust.[3]

He died at 1 Mound Place in Edinburgh on 3 November 1856 and is buried in Dean Cemetery.
