BONNIE VENT (born 11 November 1955) is an American medium and advocate who uses channeling and automatic writing as her primary means of spirit communication. Vent is known for allegedly channeling deceased celebrities.[1]


Career

Raised by an accepting mother, Vent took an interest in trying to contact spirits; being drawn to the use of a candle flame to receive messages.

In her twenties, Vent attempted channeling through automatic drawing, although this proved frustrating for her in trying to decipher. She switched to automatic writing, but found the words coming out so quickly that she was unable to write them out fast enough. This lead her instead to replay the images in her mind she was channeling and describe them to the audience, a role she describes as Spirit Advocate. Further, after a message has been given, Vent believes it is important to seek validation of the communication, and actively works as both a field researcher and historian to check out facts of a particular channeling session.

Vent claims to have started working with channeling celebrities after actor John Ritter died, reportedly due to her willingness to deliver his message. This directed her into doing more entertainment related sessions including Marilyn Monroe and Michael Jackson.[2]

Vent has worked as an investigator on historical sites, and consultant in paranormal activity. Importantly, she established set rules for paranormal research and incorporating police evidence to support the cases. An example of this was demonstrated in a TruTV pilot called _Phenomena Police_: a show featuring active duty police officers as they investigated paranormal happenings.[3]

Vent also creates spiritual art and founded _The Connection_, an association of mediums she refers to as “having high level spiritual guidance.”[4] Vent has appeared in numerous television paranormal investigations and documentaries.
