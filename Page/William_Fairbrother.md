WILLIAM FAIRBROTHER was a Canadian ice hockey player who is credited with inventing the ice hockey net in the 1890s. During the 1880s, Fairbrother played for Beamsville, Ontario's Men's Hockey team.[1] At first, two poles or two rocks served as goals, and an official would watch to see if a puck passed through the goal.[2] However, disputes arose over goals and biased officiating.[3] Then, Fairbrother, who played as a goaltender, got a net from a local fisherman and strung it from the poles.[4] Players were immediately more satisfied with the new system.[5]

The Ontario Hockey Association soon thereafter credited Fairbrother with the idea.[6] Hockey Hall of Fame records indicate that Fairbrother's idea happened in 1897 or 1898.[7] The Jordan Historical Museum of the Twenty held an exhibit on Fairbrother.[8] In February 1997, the town Lincoln, Ontario designated Fairbrother's home a historical site.[9]
