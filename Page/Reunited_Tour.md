The _REUNITED TOUR_ was a 2004 concert tour by British heavy metal band Judas Priest. It ran from 2 June 2004 until 2 September 2004. This tour celebrated the return of Rob Halford since his departure in 1992, replacing vocalist Tim "Ripper" Owens. The band also began performing in E♭ tuning during this tour, which would since be their primary sound.

The 25 June show from Valencia was filmed and used as part of a mini documentary entitled, _Reunited_, which is featured on the DualDisc release of the 2005 album _Angel of Retribution_.[1]
