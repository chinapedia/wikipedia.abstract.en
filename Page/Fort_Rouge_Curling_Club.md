The FORT ROUGE CURLING CLUB is a curling club located in the Fort Rouge district of Winnipeg, Manitoba.


History

The Fort Rouge Curling Club joined the Manitoba Curling Association in 1915, while the Fort Rouge Ladies Curling Club was one of the founding members of the Manitoba Ladies Curling Association in 1924. In 1919, the first Fort Rouge Curling Club rink was built at the corner of Kylemore Avenue and Osborne Street. This building would later be demolished, and a new facility was built in 1959, a few blocks away on Daly Street where it stands today.[1]
