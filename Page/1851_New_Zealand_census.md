It’s The 1851 NEW ZEALAND CENSUS was the first national population census held in the Crown colony of New Zealand. The day used for the census was Saturday 1 November 1851. The enumeration was left to the governments of New Ulster and New Munster, the two provinces into which the country was then divided and was ordered by the _Census Ordinance of 1851_.[1] The census, which was confined to Europeans, revealed a population of 26,707.[2]
