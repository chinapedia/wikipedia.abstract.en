ABIJAH ( _Aviya_) is a Biblical Hebrew[1] unisex name[2] that means "my Father is Yah".[3][4]


Russian name

The variant used in the Russian language is "" (_Aviya_),[5] with ""[6] or "" (_Abiya_),[7] being older forms.[8] Included into various, often handwritten, church calendars throughout the 17th–19th centuries, it was omitted from the official Synodal Menologium at the end of the 19th century.[9] In 1924–1930, the name (as "", a form of "Abiya"[10]) was included into various Soviet calendars,[11] which included the new and often artificially created names promoting the new Soviet realities and encouraging the break with the tradition of using the names in the Synodal Menologia.[12] In Russian it is only used as a female name.[13][14] Diminutives of this name include "" (_Ava_) and "" (_Viya_).[15]

-   A son of Becher, the son of Benjamin (1 Chr. 7:8).
-   The second son of Samuel (1 Samuel 8:2; 1 Chronicles 6:28). His conduct, along with that of his brother, as a judge in Beersheba, to which office his father had appointed him, led to popular discontent, and ultimately provoked the people to demand a monarchy.
-   A descendant of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, a chief of one of the twenty-four orders into which the priesthood was divided by David (1 Chr. 24:10). The order of Abijah is listed with the priests and Levites who returned with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and with Joshua. (Nehemiah 12:4; 17).

The prophet, though blind with old age, knew the wife of Jeroboam as soon as she approached, and under a divine impulse he announced to her that inasmuch as in Abijah alone of all the house of Jeroboam there was found "some good thing toward the Lord", he only would come to his grave in peace. As his mother crossed the threshold of the door on her return, the youth died, and "all Israel mourned for him" (1 Kings 14:1–18).
-   The head of the eighth of the twenty-four courses into which David divided the priests, and an ancestor of Zechariah, the priest who was the father of John the Baptist (, , ).
