ISAIAH 42 is the forty-second chapter of the Book of Isaiah in both the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet Isaiah, and is a part of the Books of the Prophets.[1] Chapters 40-55 are known as "Deutero-Isaiah" and date from the time of the Israelites' exile in Babylon. This chapter contains a poem known as the first of the "Servant songs" about the servant, whom Jewish tradition holds that Isaiah identifies as either the Israelites themselves (, _or l'goyim_) or Cyrus (in contrast to Jewish Christian and, thus, later gentile Christian tradition, as well as Islamic tradition).

Scholars such as John Goldingay, John Barton, and John Muddiman also hold the view that the Old Testament identifies the servant of the Servant songs as the Israelites in Is. 41:8-9; Is. 44:1; Is. 44:21; Is. 45:4; Is. 48:20 and Is. 49:3.[2][3] The latter two write that "The idea of a 'servant' played a small part in the earlier chapters, being used as a designation of the unworthy Eliakim in 22:20 and of the figure of David in 37:35, but it now comes to the fore as a description of major significance, the noun being used more than 20 times in chs. 40-55. Its first usage is obviously important in establishing the sense in which we are to understand it, and here it is clear that the community of Israel/Jacob is so described."[4]

Parashot

The _parashah_ sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.[5] Isaiah 42 is a part of the _Consolations (Isaiah 40‚Äì66)_. {P}: open _parashah_; {S}: closed _parashah_.

    {P} 42:1-4 {P} 42:5-9 {P} 42:10-13 {S} 42:14-17 {P} 42:18-25 [43:1-10 {S}]


Verse 1

    _‚ÄúBehold! My Servant whom I uphold,_
    _My Elect One in whom My soul delights!_
    _I have put My Spirit upon Him;_
    _He will bring forth justice to the Gentiles.‚Äù_ (NKJV)[6]

-   Cross reference: Isaiah 44:1, Jeremiah 30:10

The Synoptic Gospels each allude to verse 1 in their accounts of the Baptism of Jesus, when the Holy Spirit descends like a dove upon Jesus and a "voice from heaven" acclaims Him as "My Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." (Matthew 3:17; ; ).


Verse 3

    '' A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.''[7]

In , Sennacherib, king of Assyria, had referred to Egypt as a "broken reed", criticising Israel's dependence on Egypt during the reign of king Hezekiah.

-   "Smoking" or "dimly burning"[8]
-   "Quench" or "extinguish"[9] from the Hebrew root: k-b-h (, _kabah_, "to be quenched or extinguished, to go out"[10]), is also used in Isaiah 1:31 and Isaiah 66:24 for: "the fire that shall not be quenched"; Isaiah 34:10: 'the fire devouring Edom "will not be quenched"'; as well as in 43:17: 'those who oppose the LORD'S path are "quenched like a wick"'.


New Testament

In Matthew 12:16-21, is cited as a fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecies in the life and work of Jesus Christ:

    ''And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them all. Yet He warned them not to make Him known, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by ISAIAH THE PROPHET, saying:

        ''‚ÄúBehold! My Servant whom I have chosen,

            ''My Beloved in whom My soul is well pleased!

        ''I will put My Spirit upon Him,

            ''And He will declare justice to the Gentiles.

        ''He will not quarrel nor cry out,

            ''Nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.

        ''A bruised reed He will not break,

            ''And smoking flax He will not quench,

        ''Till He sends forth justice to victory;

            _And in His name Gentiles will trust.‚Äù_


Islamic Interpretation

Muslim tradition holds that Isaiah 42 predicted the coming of a servant associated with Qedar, the second son of Ishmael and who went on to live his life in Arabia, and so interpret this passage as a prophecy of Muhammad.[11][12] According to the Hadiths, Muslims like 'Abd Allah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As have believed that Muhammad was the servant of Isaiah 42 during his very lifetime.[13]

In 1892, Isaiah 42:1-4 was first identified by Bernhard Duhm as one of the Servant songs in the Book of Isaiah,[14] along with Is. 49:1-6; Is. 50:4-7; and Is. 52:13-53:12. The Old Testament identifies the servant of the Servant songs as the Israelite's in Is. 41:8-9; Is. 44:1; Is. 44:21; Is. 45:4; Is. 48:20 and Is. 49:3.[15][16] John Barton and John Muddiman write that "The idea of a 'servant' played a small part in the earlier chapters, being used as a designation of the unworthy Eliakim in 22:20 and of the figure of David in 37:35, but it now comes to the fore as a description of major significance, the noun being used more than 20 times in chs. 40-55. Its first usage is obviously important in establishing the sense in which we are to understand it, and here it is clear that the community of Israel/Jacob is so described."[17]
