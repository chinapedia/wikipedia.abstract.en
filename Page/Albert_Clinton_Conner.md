ALBERT CLINTON CONNER (September 5, 1848 - April 13, 1929) was an American Impressionist painter who was an integral part of the Richmond Group of painters in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After moving to California, Conner helped found The Painters' Club of Los Angeles in 1906, which lay the groundwork for the creation of the California Art Club three years later in 1909.


Early years

Albert Clinton Conner was born in Fountain City, Indiana on September 5, 1848. He was a self-taught painter who spent most of his career in Indiana.[1] Albert Conner and his brother Charles Conner (1857-1905) founded the Rambler's Sketch Club (c.1881) along with Frank J. Girardin (1856-1945) and Micajah Thomas Nordyke (1847-1919), and soon added John Elwood Bundy (1853–1933) to their group.[2] The Rambler's Sketch Club later metamorphosed into the Richmond Art Association (founded 1898, but had exhibited art in schools as early as 1896), which subsequently became the Richmond Art Museum.

Albert Conner moved to the Los Angeles area in October 1887 and became involved in the local art scene, exhibiting in local galleries.[3] His address is listed as 232 South Griffin Avenue in Los Angeles, CA.[4][5] In circa 1909 he moved his family to Manhattan Beach, CA with his residence recorded as 609 13th St, Manhattan Beach, CA.


The Painters' Club of Los Angeles

On the evening of March 17, 1906, eleven artists met at the studio [6] of William Swift Daniell (1865-1933) with the intention of forming an art club; that night The Painters' Club of Los Angeles was born. Albert Clinton "Pops" Conner was elected President of the new art club, and Antony Anderson, the first art critic for the Los Angeles Times, was selected to be the first Secretary and Treasurer. No women or sculptors were allowed, as the group was limited to male painters. "...the Painters’ Club has been formed...The president of the club is A.C. Conner."[7]

The Painters' Club of Los Angeles soon acquired a club gallery at Ford Smith & Little’s, No. 313 Broadway, and began to present one to two-month-long exhibits of members' work.[8] (See Exhibitions below for a complete listing of Albert Conner's work exhibited at Ford Smith & Little's.)

After a break over the summer of 1907, The Painters’ Club held its first meeting of the year on November 20, 1907 at the home studio of Albert Clinton Conner on S. Griffin Ave.[9] On November 26, 1907, Albert Conner is re-elected President of the club.[10]

The Painters' Club held two larger annual exhibitions; Conner participated in both of them, held at the Blanchard Art Gallery. The First Annual Exhibition was held in late 1908;[11] after that, on December 1, 1908, Conner is unanimously re-elected President.[12] The Second Annual Exhibition was held in late 1909. (For full details see Exhibitions below.) [13] Soon after this, The Painters' Club is disbanded.[14]


The California Art Club

The California Art Club (CAC) was created almost in the same moment that The Painters' Club ended in December 1909.[15] At this point, "Pops" Conner was in his 60s, but he continued to exhibit with the new group, including venues like the Long Beach Public Library Art Gallery (1910),[16] an exhibit at the new Royar and Neighbours Gallery (1912),[17] a CAC Exhibition of Sketches (1912),[18] a CAC Spring Exhibition (1912),[19]

Conner also participated in the four initial Annual CAC Exhibitions; the first two were held in 1911.[20] The Second Annual exhibition pamphlet lists Conner under a small category of exhibiting Honorary Members along with a handful of other members of The Painters' Club; elsewhere in the same pamphlet Conner is also listed as Honorary President.[21][22] Both the Third (1912) and Fourth (1913) Annual Exhibitions were first exhibited in Los Angeles and then traveled for a second showing to The San Francisco Institute of Art [23][24][25]

Conner often painted the coast near Manhattan Beach where he lived. In 1912, he was elected city treasurer of the newly incorporated town. Conner died in Manhattan Beach on April 13, 1929.[26]
