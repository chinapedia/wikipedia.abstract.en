David Hutchinson}} Dave_Hutchinson_by_Cecilia_Weightman.jpg DAVE HUTCHINSON is a science fiction writer who was born in Sheffield in England in 1960 and read American Studies at the University of Nottingham. He subsequently moved into journalism, writing for _The Weekly News_ and the _Dundee Courier_ for almost 25 years.[1] He is best known for his _Fractured Europe_ series, which has received multiple award nominations, with the third novel, _Europe in Winter_, winning the BSFA Award for Best Novel.


Early writing career

By the age of 21, Hutchinson had published four volumes of stories:[2] _Thumbprints_ (1978), _Fools' Gold_ (1979), _Torn Air_ (1980) and _The Paradise Equation_ (1981), all under the name David Hutchinson.

Writing as Dave Hutchinson, in 2004 he published _As the Crow Flies_, his fifth collection of short fiction,[3] and combined elements of horror, science fiction and fantasy. His first novel, _The Villages_ (2001), blends elements of fantasy, science fiction and the supernatural.[4] It was followed by a novella, _The Push_ (2009, NewCon Press), a science fiction story set in space, describing the inception of faster-than-light travel and speculating on the possible consequences of humans settling on planets populated by alien beings.[5] It was shortlisted for the 2010 BSFA award for short fiction.[6]

Hutchinson has also edited two anthologies and co-edited a third. His short story "The Incredible Exploding Man" was included in the first Solaris Rising anthology and appeared in the 29th Year’s _Best Science Fiction_ collection.[7]


Recent works

Hutchinson's novel _Europe in Autumn_ (2014), published by Solaris Books (now Rebellion Publishing[8]), is a speculative espionage thriller and takes place in a fragmenting near-future Europe. The central plot involves the protagonist, Estonian chef Rudi, becoming involved in Les Coureurs des Bois, a mysterious postal service that also delivers humans across borders.[9] The novel featured in a number of annual best-of-the-year round-ups, including those of _The Guardian_,[10] _The Huffington Post_ and _Locus_ magazine. The _LA Review of Books_ described _Europe In Autumn_ as "one of the most sophisticated science fiction novels of the decade".[11] _Europe at Midnight_ (2015), also published by Solaris/Rebellion, is neither a sequel nor a prequel, but rather a standalone title set in the world created for _Europe In Autumn_.[12] The second book was included in the 2015 Locus Recommended Reading List.[13]

A third novel in the series, _Europe In Winter_, was published in November 2016,[14] with the first book's protagonist returning.[15] Hutchinson completed the series with _Europe At Dawn_ in 2018, but has indicated there may be a further novella at some point in the future.[16][17]

Campbell Award.[18] In 2015 the novel was shortlisted for the Arthur C. Clarke Award[19] and John W. Campbell Memorial Award[20], and appeared on the Locus Recommended Reading list[21].
