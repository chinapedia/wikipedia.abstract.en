Rowan Alexander Sawday (born 26 August 1982) better known as his stage name DIZRAELI, is a rapper, poet and musician from Bristol, UK. Although rooted strongly in hip-hop traditions, his work draws inspiration from old folk music, recognising the common ground shared by songs of the people from any point in history.

Dizraeli has performed at the Glastonbury Festival, the Latitude Festival, the Eden Project, and the Royal Festival Hall. He has won both the Farrago UK Slam Championships and the BBC Radio 4 Poetry Slam,[1] and written several hip-hop plays including _Rebel Cell_,[2] with Baba Brinkman. Dizraeli & The Small Gods were shortlisted for the 2014 _Songlines_ Music Awards for their album _Moving in the Dark_. In 2015 they collaborated on a new video for the title track, with the BAFTA-nominated director Jamie Magnus Stone.

In 2016 Dizraeli released his EP 'Eat My Camera' and continued to tour as a solo artist.
