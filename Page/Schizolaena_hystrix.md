_SCHIZOLAENA HYSTRIX_ is a tree in the family Sarcolaenaceae. It is endemic to Madagascar. The specific epithet __ is from the Latin meaning "spiny", referring to the porcupine-like appearance of the involucre.[1]


Description

_Schizolaena hystrix_ grows as a large tree up to tall. Its leaves are coriaceous.[2] The spiny involucre is fleshy and is thought to attract lemurs, bats and birds who in turn disperse the tree's seeds.[3]


Distribution and habitat

_Schizolaena hystrix_ is known only from the northeastern regions of Sava, Alaotra-Mangoro, Analanjirofo and Atsinanana.[4] Its habitat is humid evergreen forests from sea-level to altitude.[5]


Threats

_Schizolaena hystrix_ is threatened by deforestation and by threats to the lemur. Deforestation due to shifting agriculture is occurring outside protected areas. However, 9 of 14 subpopulations of the tree are within protected areas. Threats to lemurs would in turn affect the tree's reproduction due to the their role in seed dispersal.[6]
