The 4TH CURTIS CUP MATCH was played on September 7 and 8, 1938 at the Essex County Club in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts. The United States won 5½ to 3½.[1][2][3] Britain had led by 2 points after the foursomes but America won 5 of the 6 singles to win the match.


Format

The contest was played over two days, with three foursomes on the first day and six singles matches on the second day, a total of 9 points. Matches were over 18 holes.

Each of the 9 matches was worth one point in the larger team competition. If a match was all square after the 18th hole extra holes were not played. Rather, each side earned ½ a point toward their team total. The team that accumulated at least 5 points won the competition.


Teams

Both USA and Great Britain & Ireland selected just 7 players for the event.
