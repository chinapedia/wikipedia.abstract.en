KEVIN WAYNE JETER (born March 26, 1950),[1] known both personally and professionally as K. W. JETER, is an American science fiction and horror author known for his literary writing style, dark themes, and paranoid, unsympathetic characters. He has written novels set in the _Star Trek_ and _Star Wars_ universes, and has written three sequels to _Blade Runner_.


Biography

Jeter attended college at California State University, Fullerton where he became friends with James P. Blaylock and Tim Powers, and through them, Philip K. Dick. Jeter was actually the inspiration for "Kevin" in Dick's semi-autobiographical novel, _Valis_.[2] Many of Jeter's books focus on the subjective nature of reality in a way reminiscent of Dick's.

Philip K. Dick enthusiastically recommended Jeter's early cyberpunk novel, _Dr. Adder_. Due to its violent and sexually provocative content, it took Jeter around ten years to find a publisher for it. Jeter would also coin the term steampunk, in reference to cyberpunk[3] in a letter to _Locus_ in April 1987, in order describe the steam-technology, alternate-history works that he published along with his friends, Blaylock and Powers. Jeter's steampunk novels are _Morlock Night_, _Infernal Devices_, and its sequel _Fiendish Schemes_ (2013).

As well as his own original novels, K. W. Jeter has written three authorized novel sequels to the critically acclaimed 1982 motion picture _Blade Runner_, which was adapted from Philip K. Dick's novel _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_.[4]
