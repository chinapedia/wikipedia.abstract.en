_THE THREE AND THE TWO_ is an album by drummer Shelly Manne, also featuring multi-instrumentalist Jimmy Giuffre, pianist Russ Freeman, and trumpeter Shorty Rogers. It was recorded at two sessions in 1954, originally released on two ten-inch LPs, and re-released in 1960 on a twelve-inch LP on the Contemporary label.[1]


Background

The first session (_The Three_) features Manne on drums, Rogers on trumpet, and Giuffre on clarinet, tenor and baritone sax. The second session (_The Two_) features Manne on drums and Russ Freeman on piano.

At the time of these sessions, the musicians played together in the popular West Coast group _Shorty Rogers and His Giants_; during live appearances, they often performed free improvisations, or unusual renditions of popular songs, as a trio or as a duo.

The sessions forming this record follow the same experimental approach, combining some original compositions and some re-interpretations of jazz standards, exploring different musical forms (including some reminding of European classical music), pursuing interplay and counterpoint, and researching new sound textures, as was often the case in Manne's work.


Reception

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow states: "Although these selections were not influential, they rank second in chronological order (behind Lennie Tristano's performances of 1949) among free jazz records. [...] Overall, a very interesting reissue".[2]
