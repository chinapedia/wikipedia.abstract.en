HANS-HENNING KORB (born 1988 in Berlin, Germany) is a contemporary artist based in Berlin.[1] Hans-Henning Korb holds a BFA and an MFA in visual arts from the Berlin University of the Arts, in Berlin. He studied in the class of Hito Steyerl and at the Olafur Eliasson's Institute for Spatial Experiments (Institut für Raumexperimente).,[2] and was a visiting student at the School of Fine Arts at the Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia and the Hunter College in New York City.[3] His work has been exhibited internationally, in venues such as the Empty Gallery,[4] Hong Kong (2016); Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin, Germany (2014); _Photo LA_, Los Angeles, CA, United States (2012); and many more.


Art

Hans-Henning Korb has developed a mode of art practice that transgresses traditional categories, combining sculptures, installations, and performances that involve music, film, computer animation, virtual worlds, plants, and organic processes. His aesthetics gives voice to complex contemporary human conditions and reflect on the questions that come to head as of late in contemporary life, such as the question of human autonomy in relation to both ecology and technology.[5] In most works, the physical body is present. You could say there are no bodies in the digital sphere, so it's interesting that Korb's works deal with this topic and explores the various layers of the human body and consciousness as well as its natural and technological surroundings. Fascinated by the alchemical properties of plants and foods Korb most recently created a series of installations entitled _Kaya Cynara_ that look at the emitting energy of the artichoke plant.
