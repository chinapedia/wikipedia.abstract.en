The district's fifth mayor, Sam Broughton, was elected on 8 October 2016 in the 2016 New Zealand local elections.[3]


History

Selwyn District was established as part of the 1989 local government reforms. It was formed from Ellesmere County, Malvern County, and part of Paparua County.[4] The first mayor, Anne Hurford, is from an old Ellesmere farming family. The second mayor, Bill Woods, also held the mayoralty for one term (1992–1995). Woods is a perennial candidate and once stated to be "addicted" to elections; he is one of five candidates in the 2016 mayoral election.[5][6] Michael McEvedy was mayor for four terms from 1995 to 2007, when he retired.[7] Kelvin Coe took over from McEvedy in 2007, being successful against four other candidates.[8] In the 2010 election, Coe defended himself against a challenge by former mayor Woods.[9] At the 2013 election, there were six candidates for the mayoralty, but Coe remained successful.[10] After three terms as mayor, Coe is standing down and five candidates are contesting the election, including former mayor Woods.[11]
