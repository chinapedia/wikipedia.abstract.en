Plot

Bertie is interested in parenthood, and decides to begin by marrying Bobbie Wickham. Jeeves does not approve; but Bobbie is too preoccupied with other things to give Bertie due attention. Meanwhile Bertie must put up with her niece Clementina, who has a ferocious appetite. After speaking at a girls' school, he gets another view of children and a dislike of children. The girls' behaviour towards him convinces Bertie to hate and dislike children and he knocks the idea of parenthood on the head.

Tuppy Glossop has broken off with Angela Travers again and is infatuated with dog-lover Daisy Dalgleish. Tuppy is convinced he can impress her in a rugby match, but Jeeves interferes.

Bingo Little is also in love, with a tea shop waitress. His obstacle is his allowance from his Uncle Mortimer, who may not approve the match. Jeeves recommends his uncle be regularly read romance novels to soften him up.
