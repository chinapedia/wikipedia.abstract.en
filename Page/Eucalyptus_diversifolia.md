_EUCALYPTUS DIVERSIFOLIA_, commonly known as the SOAP MALLEE, COASTAL WHITE MALLEE, SOUTH AUSTRALIAN COASTAL MALLEE, or COAST GUM[1] is a species of mallee that is endemic to an area along the southern coast of Australia. It has smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, white to creamy yellow flowers and cup-shaped fruit.


Description

_Eucalyptus diversifolia_ is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, mainly cream-coloured and grey bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile, egg-shaped to elliptic leaves arranged in opposite pairs, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same olive-green or bluish-green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven, nine or eleven in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are diamond-shaped, long and wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering occurs between July and September or December to January and the flowers are white to cream-yellow flowers. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped capsule long and wide, sessile or on a pedicel up to long with the valves about level with the rim. The seeds are smooth glossy brown and pyramidal.[2][3][4][5][6][7]


Taxonomy

_Eucalyptus diversifolia_ was first formally described by the botanist Aimé Bonpland in 1814 and the description was published in his book _Description des Plantes Rares cultivees a Malmaison et a Navarre_.[8][9]

Three subspecies were described in 1987 by Ian Wright and Pauline Ladiges and two of these are recognised by the Australian Plant Census (APC):

-   _Eucalyptus diversifolia_ subsp. _diversifolia_[10] has smooth bark and cup-shaped fruit less than in diameter;[11]
-   _Eucalyptus diversifolia_ subsp. _hesperia_[12] has a short skirt of rough bark at the base and fruit that is usually smaller than in subspecies _diversifolia_.[13]

_Eucalyptus diversifolia_ subsp. _megacarpa_ is regarded as a synonym of _E. diversifolia_ subsp. _diversifolia_ by the APC but is an accepted subspecies in Victoria and has fruit that is in diameter.[14][15]

This species is part of the _Eucalyptus_ subgenus series _Diversiformae_, a group of mallees that all have adult leaves held erect, buds with a single unscarred operculum and pyramidal seeds. The other species in this series include _E. erectifolia_, _E. platydisca_, _E. pachyloma_, _E. todtiana_, _E. lateritica_, _E. dolorosa_ and _E. buprestium_.[16]


Distribution

Soap mallee grows in soils derived from limestone, often on exposed headlands. Subspecies _diversifolia_ is found on the Eyre and lower Yorke Peninsulas, on Kangaroo Island in South Australia and eastwards to the Cape Nelson State Park with an isolated population near Aireys Inlet in Victoria, but it is absent from the Nullarbor Plain in far western South Australia. Subspecies _hesperia_ occurs west of the Nullarbor Plain between Eucla, Caiguna, Cocklebiddy and Madura.[17][18][19][20]


Uses

This species is able to produce large amounts of biomass, making per hectare per year. In wheatbelt regions it is also beneficial as the tree will reduce salinity, give shade to stock, act as a windbreak and reduce erosion.[21]
