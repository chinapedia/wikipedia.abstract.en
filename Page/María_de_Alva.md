Published works

Maria de Alva has been a finalist for the Lara de Novela award of Spain twice. Her first nomination was in 2004 for her book _A través de la ventana_ (Through the Window) and in 2009 for her novel _Antes del olvido_ (Before Oblivion).[5][6]

Her book _A través de la ventana_, describes how Ida, who is the main character, together with her family are trying to escape not only from war during the Mexican Revolution, but also from German traditionalism and exile in Mexico. They were the first Jewish family to come to Monterrey, Mexico. This book was a finalist because it represents the cruelty, reality, necessity, hope and fear while searching for a better life.[7] It also portrays issues like family, sickness, pain, exile and memory. The novel uses three types of narrators, a diary in the first person, a recollection in the second person and a third person that tells most of the story.[8]

Her most recent book _Lo que guarda el río_ (What the river Keeps) was inspired by the deaths of two students from Tecnológico de Monterrey, where she works, due to narco violence. Also it has to do with the disaster brought upon the city of Monterrey by Hurricane Alex in 2010. The author's purpose is to show through characters of different social classes how violence and nature force interactions among them even if in the end each separate once again.[9][10][11]
