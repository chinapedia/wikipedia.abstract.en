NGC 6528 is a globular cluster in the constellation Sagittarius, and is listed in the New General Catalogue. It has an apparent magnitude of about 11 and a diameter of about 16 arcminutes, and its Shapley-Sawyer Concentration Class is V, containing stars of 16th magnitude and dimmer.[1] Dreyer described it as "pF, cS, R", meaning poor and faint, considerably small and round.

NGC 6528 is located southwest of NGC 6522, another globular cluster. Both are located in Baade's Window, a relatively clear area in the galactic equator.

The globular cluster was discovered in 1784 by the astronomer William Herschel with his 18-inch telescopes.
