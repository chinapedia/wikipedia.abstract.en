ALEX CAMERON (born circa 1990) is an Australian musician, singer and songwriter. Born and raised in Sydney, he is best known for his solo career, a high-concept act in which Cameron initially adopted the persona of a failed entertainer. He is also a member of the electronica act Seekae.[1] During live performances, Cameron is often joined by saxophonist and "business partner" Roy Molloy.

Cameron independently released his debut album, _Jumping the Shark_, for free on his website in 2013. After catching the attention of indie rock duo Foxygen at a concert in Paris, Cameron toured extensively with Mac DeMarco, Kevin Morby, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Angel Olsen. In 2016, Secretly Canadian reissued the album to a wider audience and growing cult fanbase.

While promoting the album, Cameron struck up a friendship with The Killers frontman Brandon Flowers and co-wrote five tracks on the band's fifth studio album, _Wonderful Wonderful_. In 2017, Cameron released his second studio album, _Forced Witness_, featuring contributions from Molloy, Flowers, Olsen and Jonathan Rado.


Career

_Jumping the Shark_ (2013-2016)

Regarding his adopted persona of that of a failed musician, Cameron notes, "I write about the outlier, the table-for-one guy, the guy whose life is a constellation of microscopic tragedies. Failure has been underexplored in music. My characters come from a place where ambition, crippling self-doubt and tragedy intersect."[2]

After releasing his debut album, _Jumping the Shark_, for free on his website, and physically through Siberia Records, Cameron attracted the attention of indie rock duo Foxygen while performing at David Lynch's Parisian club, Silencio.[3] While on tour with Kevin Morby, in April 2016, the label Secretly Canadian announced they had signed Cameron and would be re-releasing _Jumping the Shark_ in August 2016. Upon the announcement, Cameron issued the following statement: "Its 2016 [sic], and its time for Alex Cameron. Entertainer. Showman. Shaman. Side by side with his business partner and saxophonist, Roy Molloy, the duo are a living and breathing story of success told through the internet; unedited, unscripted, and, up until now, to a dedicated audience of no one. Thanks to the good people at Secretly Canadian that is about to change."[4]

_Forced Witness_ (2017-2018)

In 2017, Cameron released his second studio album, _Forced Witness_, a departure from the mostly-electronic sound of his debut album, the album was produced by Foxygen's Jonathan Rado, and features a full-band production, including saxophonist Roy Molloy. That same year, Cameron co-wrote five tracks on The Killers' fifth studio album, _Wonderful Wonderful_, with frontman Brandon Flowers appearing on the closing track of _Forced Witness_, "Politics of Love".

The album's accompanying tour found Cameron fronting a full band - including his business partner Molloy and session musicians, keyboardist Holiday Sidewinder, guitarist Justin Nijssen - and supporting The Killers on their UK and US arena tour.

On September 26, 2018, Cameron and Molloy hosted a 24-hour telethon via Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook Live with the express goal to "save the music industry and pad our pantry out by selling 1000 records in 24 hours", which they succeeded in doing.

_Miami Memory_ (2019-present)

On June 18, 2019, Cameron announced his third studio album, _Miami Memory_. The album will be released on September 13, 2019 via Secretly Canadian.[5]
