_THE REN & STIMPY SHOW_, also known as _REN & STIMPY_, is an American animated television series created by John Kricfalusi for Nickelodeon. The series follows the adventures of title characters Ren, an emotionally unstable chihuahua and Stimpy, a good-natured yet dimwitted cat. The show premiered on August 11, 1991, as one of the original three Nicktoons alongside _Rugrats_ and _Doug_. Throughout its run, the show was controversial for its off-color and dark humor, sexual innuendos, adult jokes, and violence. The production's failure to deliver episodes on time and its deteriorating relationship with Nickelodeon executives and Standards and Practices department led to Kricfalusi's departure from the show in 1992. The show ended on December 16, 1995, with a total of five seasons and 52 episodes.

_Ren & Stimpy_ received positive reviews during its original run. It would go on to receive widespread critical acclaim after its run and has since developed a cult following and had a long-lasting influence on television animation. A spin-off for adult audiences, _Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon"_, aired in 2003 on Spike. Only three episodes aired due to delays in episode delivery, before Spike removed its entire animation programming block.


Premise

The series centers on Ren Höek (voiced by John Kricfalusi in seasons 1–2; Billy West in seasons 3–5), a short-tempered, "asthma-hound" Chihuahua,[1] and Stimpson J. "Stimpy" Cat (also voiced by Billy West), a dimwitted and happy-go-lucky cat.[2] The duo fill various roles from episode to episode, including outer-space explorers, Old West horse thieves, and nature-show hosts,[3] and are usually at odds with each other in these situations. While the show was sometimes set in the present day, the show's crew tended to avoid "contemporary" jokes about current events.[4] The show extensively features off-color[5] and absurdist humor, as well as slapstick.[6]

The show features a host of supporting characters. Some appear only in one episode, while others recur and occasionally appear in different roles. They may either be part of the storyline or make cameo appearances with little bearing on the plot. Some, such as Mr. Horse, are exclusively cameo-based, spontaneously appearing as a running gag.[7]


Development and history

Conception

According to animator William Wray, John Kricfalusi created the characters Ren and Stimpy in 1978 for "personal amusement" while studying at Sheridan College in Ontario, Canada.[8] He was inspired to create Ren by an Elliott Erwitt photograph, printed on a postcard, called "New York City, 1946", showing a sweatered chihuahua at a woman's feet. Stimpy's design was inspired by a Tweety Bird cartoon called _A Gruesome Twosome_ where the cats in the animation had big noses.[9]

When Nickelodeon approached Kricfalusi, he presented three shows, among them a variety show titled _Your Gang_[10] or _Our Gang_[11] with a live action host presenting different cartoons, each cartoon parodying a different genre. Ren and Stimpy were pets of one of the children in _Your Gang_, serving as a parody of the "cat and dog genre". The network's vice president of animation production Vanessa Coffey was dissatisfied with the other projects but did like Ren and Stimpy, singling them out for their own series.[12][13] Production of the series' pilot episode began in 1989 after Kricfalusi pitched and sold _The Ren & Stimpy Show_ to Nickelodeon.[14] The pilot was produced by Kricfalusi's Los Angeles-based animation company, Spümcø, and screened at film festivals for several months before the show was announced in Nickelodeon's 1991 cartoons line-up.[15]

Spümcø (1991–1993)

The series premiered on August 11, 1991 alongside _Doug_ and _Rugrats_. Spümcø continued to produce the show for the next two years while encountering issues with Nickelodeon's Standards and Practices.[16] The show was known for its lack of early merchandising;[17] according to Wray, the initial lack of merchandise was "the unique and radical thing" about _The Ren & Stimpy Show_, as no toy company planned ahead for any merchandise for the show, and Nickelodeon did not want to use "over-exploitive" merchandising.[18]

Kricfalusi described his early period with Nickelodeon as being "simple", as he got along with Coffey, the sole executive of the program. When another executive was added, he wanted to alter or discard some of the _Ren & Stimpy_ episodes, but Kricfalusi says the episodes stayed intact since he did a "trade" with Coffey: he would have some "really crazy" episodes in exchange for some "heart-warming" episodes.[19] Kricfalusi also said that the program was the "safest project [he] ever worked on" while explaining the meaning of "safe" as "spend a third of what they spend now per picture, hire proven creative talent, and let them entertain." He estimated Spümcø's run of _The Ren & Stimpy Show_ cost around $6 million to produce.[20]

The relationship between Kricfalusi and Nickelodeon deteriorated to the point where Kricfalusi would communicate with Nickelodeon only through his lawyer.[21] News outlets and several of the series' staff ascribe the tension to episodes not being delivered in a timely manner.[22][23][24][25][26] Author Andy Mangels, writing for _Wizard_ magazine, commented that "Kricfalusi's lax treatment of deadlines pissed off not only the networks, but his loyal viewers as well."[27] However, some of the delays were attributed to Nickelodeon's prolonged approval process[28] and withdrawal of approval from scenes and episodes that had been previously approved.[29][30][31] Another point of contention was the direction of the series. Kricfalusi cites the episode "Man's Best Friend" as the primary reason for his dismissal;[32] the character George Liquor is depicted in the episode as an abusive father figure, and Nickelodeon did not want the show to be so frightening and dramatic.[33]

Games Animation (1993–1995)

Nickelodeon terminated Kricfalusi's contract in late September 1992[34][35] and offered him the position of consultant for _Ren & Stimpy_, but he refused to "sell out".[36] The network moved production from Spümcø to its newly founded animation studio, Games Animation, which later became Nickelodeon Animation Studio.[37] Bob Camp replaced Kricfalusi as director,[38] while West, having refused Kricfalusi's request to leave along with him,[39] voiced Ren in addition to Stimpy.[40][41][42][43]

Fans and critics felt this was a turning point in the show, with the new episodes being a considerable step down from the standard of those that preceded them.[44][45] Ted Drozdowski, resident critic of _The Boston Phoenix_, stated that "the bloom faded on _Ren & Stimpy_".[46] Animation historian Michael Barrier writes that while the creators of the Games episodes used bathroom humor jokes that were similar to those used by Kricfalusi, they did not "find the material particularly funny; they were merely doing what was expected".[47]

The series ended its original run on December 16, 1995, with "A Scooter for Yaksmas", although one episode from the final season, "Sammy and Me/The Last Temptation", remained unaired.[48] Almost a year later, the episode aired on Nickelodeon's sister network, MTV, on October 20, 1996.[49]


Production

Process

The animation production methods used in _The Ren & Stimpy Show_ were similar to those found in Golden Age cartoons of the early 20th century, where a director supervised the entire process.[50][51][52] These methods are in contrast to animation production methods in the 1980s, where there was one director for animation and a different director for voice actors, and the cartoons were created with a "top-down" approach to tie in with toy production.[53][54]

Animator Vincent Waller compared working on _Ren & Stimpy_ and _SpongeBob SquarePants_ in an interview: "Working on _Ren and Stimpy_ and _SpongeBob_ was very similar. They're both storyboard-driven shows, which means they give us an outline from a premise after the premise has been approved. We take the outline and expand on it, writing the dialogue and gags. That was very familiar."[55] According to Kricfalusi, _Ren & Stimpy_ reintroduced the layouts stage, and reemphasized the storyboard stage.[56][57][58] Eventually, the production staff drew larger storyboard panels, which allowed for the stories to be easily changed according to reactions from pitch meetings, and for new ideas to be integrated.[59]

Animation

The show's aesthetics draw on Golden Age cartoons,[60][61][62] particularly those of animator Bob Clampett from the 1940s in the way the characters' emotions powerfully distort their bodies.[63] The show's style emphasizes unique expressions, intense and specific acting, and strong character poses.[64][65] One of the show's most notable visual trademarks is the detailed paintings of gruesome close-ups,[66] along with the blotchy ink stains that on occasion replace the standard backgrounds, "reminiscent of holes in reality or the vision of a person in a deep state of dementia".[67] This style was developed from Clampett's _Baby Bottleneck_, which features several scenes with color-cards for backgrounds.[68] The show incorporated norms from "the old system in TV and radio" where the animation would feature sponsored products to tie in with the cartoon, however in lieu of real advertisements, it featured fake commercial breaks advertising nonexistent products, most notably "Log".[69]

Kricfalusi cited Carbunkle Cartoons, an animation studio headed by Bob Jaques and Kelly Armstrong, for beautifully animating the show's best episodes, improving the acting with subtle nuances and wild animation that could not be done with overseas animation studios.[70][71] Some of the show's earlier episodes were rough to the point Kricfalusi felt the need to patch up the animation with sound effects and "music bandaids", helping the segments "play better, even though much of the animation and timing weren't working on their own."[72] KJ Dell'Antonia of _Common Sense Media_ describes the show's style as changing "from intentionally rough to much more polished and plushie-toy ready."[73]

Voice acting

Kricfalusi originally voiced Ren, styled as a demented Peter Lorre.[74][75] When Nickelodeon terminated Kricfalusi's contract, Billy West, already the voice of Stimpy, took the role using a combination of Burl Ives, Kirk Douglas, and a slight "south of the border accent" for the rest of the Nickelodeon run.[76] West voiced Stimpy for the Spümcø and Games Animation episodes, basing the voice on an "amped-up" Larry Fine.[77] Some notable artists and performers who voiced incidental characters on the show are Frank Zappa, Randy Quaid, Gilbert Gottfried, Rosie O'Donnell, Dom DeLuise, Phil Hartman, Mark Hamill, and Soleil Moon Frye.[78]

Music

_The Ren & Stimpy Show_ features a wide variety of music, spanning rockabilly, folk, pop, jazz, classical music, jingles, and more. The opening and closing themes are performed by a group of Spümcø employees under the name "Die Screaming Leiderhôsens".[79][80] Three _Ren & Stimpy_ albums have been released: _You Eediot!_, _Crock O' Christmas_ and _Radio Daze_. In addition to music written specifically for the show, a number of episodes used existing works by composers such as jazz musician Raymond Scott, Claude Debussy, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Ludwig van Beethoven, Alexander Borodin, Antonín Dvořák, Gioachino Rossini (particularly _The Thieving Magpie_), and selections from production music libraries such as APM Music, which fans later compiled into several albums.[81][82] In 1993 a compilation album, _You Eediot!_, was released as a soundtrack album. The album's front cover is a parody of The Beatles' 11th studio album _Abbey Road_. Stimpy's rousing anthem titled "Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy" was composed by Christopher Reccardi[83] and written by Charlie Brissette and John Kricfalusi. A cover of this song, performed by Wax, is included on the 1995 tribute album _Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits_, produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records. The line "happy, happy, joy, joy" is first used in episode three of the series; the song is first played in episode six. It is sung by a character introduced as "Stinky Whizzleteats",[84] who is named in the episode's script as Burl Ives, an American folk singer and actor.[85] The song liberally quotes numerous lyrics and lines of dialogue from Ives's films and records, creating a series of non sequiturs.


Controversy and censorship

The program's staff did not want to create an "educational" series, a stance which bothered Nickelodeon.[86] Parent groups criticized the series.[87][88] Some segments of the show were altered to exclude references to religion, politics, and alcohol. The episode "Powdered Toast Man" had a cross removed from the Pope's hat and the credits changed to "the man with the pointy hat". The same episode had a segment featuring the burning of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights which was removed, while in "Dog Show" the last name of the character George Liquor was removed.[89] Several episodes had violent, gruesome, or suggestive scenes shortened or removed, including a sequence involving a severed head, a close-up of Ren's face being grated against a man's stubble,[90] and a scene that was shortened where Ren receives multiple punches to the stomach from a baby. One episode, "Man's Best Friend", was shelved by Nickelodeon for its violent content. The show's spin-off, _Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon"_, debuted with this banned episode.[91]


Episodes

The series ran for five seasons, spanning 52 episodes.[92] The show was produced by Kricfalusi's animation studio Spümcø for the first two seasons. Beginning with season three (1993–94), the show was produced by Nickelodeon's Games Animation. The episode "Man's Best Friend" was produced for season two, but the episode was shelved and debuted with the show's adult spin-off. Another episode, "Sammy and Me / The Last Temptation", aired on MTV on October 20, 1996, almost a year after the original Nickelodeon run ended.[93]


Reception

_The Ren & Stimpy Show_ received widespread critical acclaim.[94] Matt Groening, creator of _The Simpsons_, praised the show for its outrageousness[95] and called it "the only good cartoon on TV" other than _The Simpsons_.[96] Terry Thoren, former CEO and president of Klasky Csupo, said that Kricfalusi "tapped into an audience that was a lot hipper than anybody thought. He went where no man wanted to go before – the caca, booger humor".[97] Jonathan Valania of _The Morning Call_ called it "high voltage yuks and industrial-strength weirdness",[98] John Lyttle of _The Independent_ described it as "a gooey media meltdown, absolutely grotesque and instantly recognisable" and did not consider it a children's cartoon.[99]

The show came to garner high ratings for Nickelodeon,[100][101][102][103][104] having double the viewership of the other Nickelodeon cartoons for its first season[105] and later averaging three times their viewership.[106] The show for a time was the most popular cable TV show,[107] with several airings being the most-watched scripted cable TV show in 1993 in the United States.[108] The show quickly developed a cult following in college campuses,[109][110][111] and was included in the launch of Nickelodeon's _Snick_, a late-night block for shows that appeal to both children and adults.[112]


Legacy and influence

The immediate influence of the show was the spawning of two "clones": Hanna-Barbera's _2 Stupid Dogs_, in which Spümcø employees including Kricfalusi had some limited involvement after their departure from _Ren & Stimpy_; and Disney's _The Shnookums and Meat Funny Cartoon Show_.[113] However, the show had a wider influence on the future of animation.[114][115] Mike Judge credits MTV's willingness to commission _Beavis and Butt-Head_ to the success of _Ren & Stimpy_ on the network.[116] Writer Larry Brody credits _Ren & Stimpy_ for leading a new golden age of animation, as other networks followed Nickelodeon and invested in new cartoons, opening the way for more adult-oriented satirical shows like _Beavis and Butt-Head_.[117] Writer/animator Allan Neuwirth writes that _Ren & Stimpy_ "broke the mold" and started several trends in TV animation, chiefly the revival of credits at the beginning of each episode, the use of grotesque close-ups, and a shift in cartoon color palettes to richer, more harmonious colors.[118] A direct influence can be seen in the series _SpongeBob SquarePants_ with the physically extreme drawings that contrast with the characters' usual appearance, the "grotesque close-ups".[119]

The characters became a cultural touchstone in the mid-1990s, and were featured in works such as the film _Clueless_.[120] _Ren & Stimpy_ placed 31st in TV Guide's list of "Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time" in 2002.[121] The cover story of the October 2001 issue of _Wizard_, a magazine for comic book fans, listed the 100 Greatest Toons ever as selected by their readers, with _Ren & Stimpy_ ranked at number 12.[122] Other entertainment journals similarly hold _Ren & Stimpy_ as one of the best cartoons of the '90s and cartoons for adults.[123][124][125][126]


Revivals

_Adult Party Cartoon_ (2003)

In 2003, Kricfalusi headed the relaunch of the series as _Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon"_. The new version was aired during a late night programming block on Spike TV and was rated TV-MA. The series explores more adult themes, including an explicitly homosexual relationship between the main characters,[127] and an episode filled with female nudity.[128] Billy West declined to participate in the show, saying that the show was "not funny" and that joining it would have damaged his career.[129] Eric Bauza voiced Stimpy, while Kricfalusi reprised the role of Ren. The show began with the "banned" Nickelodeon episode "Man's Best Friend" before debuting new episodes. Fans and critics alike were unsettled by the show from the first episode,[130] which featured the consumption of bodily fluids such as nasal mucus, saliva, and vomit.[131] Only three of the ordered nine episodes were produced on time. After three episodes, Spike's entire animation block was removed from its programming schedule.[132]

Other revivals

In February 2016, _Deadline.com_ reported that _Ren & Stimpy_ was scheduled to appear in an upcoming _Nicktoons_ film reboot.[133] Three months later, _Variety_ reported that Nickelodeon was in negotiations with Kricfalusi about a revival of the characters.[134] Bob Camp and William Wray stated in an April 2016 panel discussion that Kricfalusi was developing a _Ren & Stimpy_ short that would screen along with the third _SpongeBob SquarePants_ film. They later said that they were "not invited to that party" and would not be involved with the production.[135] However, Kricfalusi denied on Twitter that he was making such a cartoon.[136] An animatic of the short was released as an Easter egg on the _Cans Without Labels_ DVD in May 2019.[137][138]


Home media

VHS, LaserDisc, UMD

Sony Wonder initially distributed collections of episodes of _The Ren & Stimpy Show_ on VHS, which were not grouped by air dates or season.[139] Eventually, the rights for Nickelodeon's programming on home video transferred from Sony to Paramount Home Video. Paramount only released one video of _The Ren & Stimpy Show_, "Have Yourself a Stinky Little Christmas", which was actually a re-release of a Sony video from several years earlier.

During the mid and late 1990s, a themed selection of _The Ren & Stimpy Show_ episodes were released in a number of VHS releases in Australia by Nickelodeon and Paramount Home Entertainment. Most of the videos were G-classified due to some scenes that were cut but other certain videos were classified PG. _The Ren & Stimpy Show_ was also released on LaserDisc in the United States by Sony Wonder. There was only one release, "Ren and Stimpy: The Essential Collection", which featured the same episodes as the VHS release. On September 25, 2005, a compilation titled _The Ren & Stimpy Show: Volume 1_ was released in the U.S. on UMD, the proprietary media for the PlayStation Portable.

DVD

United States

Time–Life released several episodes of _The Ren & Stimpy Show_ in a "Best of" set in September 2003.[140] This set is now out of print.[141] On October 12, 2004, Paramount Home Entertainment released the first two complete seasons in a three-disc box set. Although the cover art and press materials said the episodes were "uncut", a handful of episodes were, in fact, edited, due to the use of Spike TV masters where Spike TV would cut some scenes from episodes to make room for longer commercial breaks.[142] One of the episodes from the second season, "Svën Höek", did have footage reinserted from a work-in-progress VHS tape, but with an editing machine timecode visible on-screen; the scene was later restored by fans. Three other episodes ("Powdered Toast Man", "Dog Show", and "Big House Blues") contain extra footage that wasn't originally broadcast on Nickelodeon.[143] The DVD set even includes the banned episode "Man's Best Friend" as a bonus feature. A set for "Seasons Three and a Half-ish", containing all of season three and the first half of season four up to "It's a Dog's Life/Egg Yölkeo", followed on June 28, 2005.[144][145] _Season Five and Some More of Four_ completed the DVD release of the Nickelodeon series on September 20.[146] Like the previous DVDs, some scenes were removed in these releases.

A two-disc set dubbed _The Lost Episodes_ was released on July 17, 2006, featuring both the aired and unaired episodes from "Ren & Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon", as well as clips from unfinished cartoons.[147]

Paramount released "The Almost Complete Series" 9-disc set that combines the individual season discs into a single package, on February 6, 2018.[148]

Europe

The original series was released entirely as a 9-disc set in Germany on October 4, 2013. After people said that two episodes on the second disc were not completely uncensored, Turbine Classics offered to send everybody with proof of purchase an uncensored disc.[149] The set comprises a mix of the known US airings and the German TV airings which included some exclusive scenes of various episodes. Since the set is the first to include all scenes ever broadcast worldwide, it is considered the first truly uncensored DVD release of the series.[150][151]


Other media

Video games

Seven action games based directly on the television series were released between 1992 and 1995.

-   _THE REN & STIMPY SHOW: SPACE CADET ADVENTURES_ was developed by Imagineering, published by THQ and released for the Game Boy on November 1992. The game's premise centers on Stimpy attempting to rescue a stranded Ren, who is simultaneously traversing alien worlds attempting to return to their ship. The game received middling reviews and was praised for its faithful humor and visuals, but criticized for its repetitive and unimaginative gameplay.[152][153]
-   _THE REN & STIMPY SHOW: VEEDIOTS!_ was developed by Gray Matter Inc., published by THQ and released for the SNES and Game Boy on October 1993. The game is composed of four stages based on episodes from the television series. Both versions of the game received middling reviews. The SNES version was praised for its faithful visuals and audio, but criticized for its repetitive stages, standard gameplay and sluggish controls.[154][155] _Nintendo Power_ commented that the Game Boy version had good graphics, but poor controls and challenge.[156]
-   _THE REN & STIMPY SHOW PRESENTS: STIMPY'S INVENTION_ was developed by BlueSky Software, published by Sega and released for the Sega Genesis on November 1993. The game's premise follows Ren and Stimpy as they travel through their neighborhood and collect scattered pieces of Stimpy's latest invention, the Mutate-O-Matic. The game features a two-player mode in which each player controls one of the two titular characters. The reviewers of _Electronic Gaming Monthly_ praised the game's faithful and humorous visuals and audio, but derided the two-player mode as "more aggravating than fun" and "twice as hard as a one-player [game]".[157]
-   _QUEST FOR THE SHAVEN YAK STARRING REN HOËK & STIMPY_ was developed by Realtime Associates, published by Sega and released for the Game Gear on November 1993. The game's premise centers on Ren and Stimpy's mission to return the hooves of the Great Shaven Yak. Scary Larry of _GamePro_ praised the music as "worth the price of admission" and the graphics as "very good by Game Gear standards".[158]
-   _THE REN & STIMPY SHOW: BUCKEROO$_ was developed by Imagineering, published by THQ and released for the NES on December 1993, and for the SNES on April 1995. The game features three levels based on the television episodes "Space Madness", "Out West", and "Robin Höek". _Nintendo Power_ noted that the NES version's graphics "capture the artistic flavor of the cartoon series", but criticized the poor controls and unengaging game elements.[159] Conversely, the SNES version was commended for having more gameplay variety than previous _Ren & Stimpy_ titles, but the graphics were described as "[not] very _Ren & Stimpy_ish".[160]
-   _THE REN & STIMPY SHOW: FIRE DOGS_ was developed by Argonaut Games, published by THQ and released for the SNES on March 1994. The game is split into two distinct parts; in the first part, the player controls Stimpy, who must traverse through a firehouse and gather all the equipment for a firetruck in a limited time while avoiding the Fire Chief, while the second part puts the player in control of both Ren and Stimpy, who must catch items that are thrown out of a burning building. _Nintendo Power_ commended the game's graphics, humor, audio, and inclusion of a password feature, but criticized the lack of variety, limited time allotted for collecting items and repetition of the two levels.[161]
-   _THE REN & STIMPY SHOW: TIME WARP_ was developed by Sculptured Software, published by THQ and released for the SNES on October 1994. The game's premise centers on Ren and Stimpy's efforts to navigate through time and stop Muddy Mudskipper from ruining history. The reviewers of _Electronic Gaming Monthly_ praised the game's animations and various attacks, but stated that the controls "could be tweaked up a little more".[162] _Next Generation_ reviewed the game, rating it one star out of five, and stated that "When Nickelodeon fired creator John Kricfalusi, the heart and soul were sucked out of the pair. This game puts the final nail in the coffin."[163]

Aside from these dedicated titles, Ren, Stimpy, and other characters from the series make appearances in the Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker,[164] _Nicktoons Racing_,[165] and _Nicktoons MLB_.[166]

Comic books

Marvel Comics optioned the rights to produce comic books based on Nickelodeon properties in 1992. The initial plan was to have an anthology comic featuring several Nicktoons properties. Marvel produced 44 issues of the ongoing series, along with several specials under the _Marvel Absurd_ imprint. Most of these were written by comic scribe Dan Slott. One _Ren & Stimpy_ special #3, _Masters of Time and Space_, was set up as a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' and with a time travel plot, took Slott six months to plot out in his spare time. It was designed so that it was possible to choose a path that would eventually be 20 pages longer than the comic itself. Issue #6 of the series starred Spider-Man battling Powdered Toast Man. The editors named the "Letters to the Editor" section "Ask Dr. Stupid", and at least one letter in every column would be a direct question for Dr. Stupid to answer.[167] This comic series lasted from December 1992-July 1996.

Film adaptation attempts

Nickelodeon and 20th Century Fox signed a two-year production deal in May 1993 for the development and production of animated and live-action family films, based on new or existing properties. _Ren & Stimpy_ was mentioned as a possible property for development, along with _Rugrats_ and _Doug_; however, the show's "cynical and gross humor" was a poor fit for a conventional, "warm and fuzzy" family film.[168][169] The deal expired with no movies produced. Nickelodeon would later start its own film studio after parent company Viacom purchased Paramount Pictures.

At the Wizard World Cleveland convention in March 2017, Camp said that Paramount Pictures rejected a pitch for a _Ren & Stimpy_ feature film because of the "sour taste" left by _Adult Party Cartoon_, and they did not want any further connection with the characters.[170]
