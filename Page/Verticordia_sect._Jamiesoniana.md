_VERTICORDIA_ SECT. _JAMIESONIANA_ is one of six sections in the subgenus _Eperephes_. It includes the single species _Verticordia jamiesonii_. Plants in this section have tiny, yellowish leaves and white flowers that turn pink as they age and have stamens and staminodes with slightly thickened hairs.[1]

When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991, he described the section and gave it the name _Jamiesoniana_ after the type species _V. jamiesonii_ named by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1883.[2][3]

The type and only species in this section is _Verticordia jamiesonii_.[4]
