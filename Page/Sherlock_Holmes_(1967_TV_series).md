_SHERLOCK HOLMES_ is a German 1967 television series featuring Erich Schellow as Sherlock Holmes and Paul Edwin Roth as Dr. Watson.

The series aired on WDR from 28 August 1967 to 13 February 1968[1] and is formed by six episodes, each one adapting a Sherlock Holmes short story written by Arthur Conan Doyle, though the scripts are based on the adaptations made in the first season of the British TV series _Sherlock Holmes_ (1965-1968).[2] A DVD was issued in 2012 as number 45 in the _Straßenfeger_ compilation series of crime-related film and TV productions, along with _Conan Doyle und der Fall Edalji_ (1966) and _Sherlock Holmes und das Halsband des Todes_ (1962), all with German language soundtracks only, and no subtitles.
