CHUN MYUNG-HOON (born April 6, 1978) is a South Korean singer, rapper, actor and television presenter. He is a member of boy band NRG. He released his single, _Welcome To The Jungle_ on October 19, 2012.[1] He is well known as a cast member on several TV shows, including _Girl Spirit_.


Career

Early years

Chun's passion for dance began early and he had been part of a break-dancing crew during his teenage years. Despite his father's opposition to him entering show business, Chun began his career as a backup dancer and debuted in 1996 as one-half of the dance-pop duo Hamo Hamo (ko) with Lee Sung-jin, while Noh Yoo-min and Moon Sung-hoon served as their backup dancers.[2] The foursome would go on to form NRG. As they debuted around the same time as H.O.T., Chun quipped on _Handsome Boys of the 20th Century_ that NRG would not have been formed had Hamo Hamo not been overshadowed by the massive success of H.O.T.

1997–2009: NRG, military service and disbandment

In 1997, the four members of Hamo Hamo and new addition Kim Hwan-sung (died in 2000) were formed into a boy band called NRG, which stood for "New Radiancy Group". The group had their big break with the 2003 single "Hit Song", composed by Chun, and won their first ever #1 on a music program. With Moon having left the group in 2004, the group took a break before releasing their seventh album _One of Five_. They went on hiatus while Chun and Noh served their mandatory military service from 2007 to 2009.[3] However their future plans of a comeback were put on hold due to Lee's fraud and gambling investigation and they eventually agreed to go their separate ways.

2009–2016: Solo activities

After NRG's disbandment, Chun was the only member who remained in the entertainment industry; Noh and Moon had both entered the business world while Lee stayed out of the public eye due to his legal troubles. Chun began his career as a solo singer and a cast member on various variety shows. He was a main cast member on the variety-reality show _Handsome Boys of the 20th Century_ which featured his fellow first-generation counterparts Moon Hee-jun and Tony An of H.O.T., Sechs Kies leader and rapper Eun Ji-won and rapper Danny Ahn of g.o.d, all of whom were born in the year 1978.[4] The five entertainers formed a "group" called HOTSechgodRG, a combination of all their idol group names, and remade NRG's debut song "I Can Do It" (할 수 있어).

2017: NRG's comeback

On October 22, 2016, Chun reunited with Noh Yoo-min and Lee Sung-jin to announce that NRG would be returning the following year to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their debut.[5]
