Reception

Alasdair Wilkins of _The A.V. Club_ gave the episode a B, he explained his rating by saying, "“The Horse Rider-er” is a solid episode, and one that I liked more than my critique of the main story might suggest. This is a good example of a pleasant, effective Bob’s Burgers episode, one that doesn’t necessarily do anything egregiously wrong but also doesn’t quite do those crucial things right that would push the episode into that next echelon. But hey, we’ve got Teddy freaking out over the fryer situation, Bob going all-in on his role as the camp’s owner, the world’s most bored riding instructor, and Paul Rudd as the voice of Tina’s imaginary horse. I can only argue against an episode with all that so much, you know?"[2]

The episode received a 1.0 rating and was watched by a total of 2.27 million people.[3]
