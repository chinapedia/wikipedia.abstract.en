_' Jerry Corbitt_' (born JERRY BYRON CORBITT; January 7, 1943 – March 8, 2014) was an American guitarist, harmonica player, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is best known as a founding member and guitarist of the rock band the Youngbloods.


Career

Corbitt was born in Tifton, Georgia.[1][2] He began his career in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the beginning of the 1960s as a bluegrass musician, then was known as a folk singer. In mid-1960s, Corbitt met Jesse Colin Young, a moderately successful folk singer born in Queens, New York City. In January 1965, the two began touring in Canada as a duo, eventually naming themselves the Youngbloods. Young played bass, and Corbitt played piano, harmonica and lead guitar. Later on, they were joined by Corbitt's friend Lowell “Banana” Levinger, a bluegrass musician, and the drummer Joe Bauer.[3]

In 1967, having signed with RCA Records, they released their first _Billboard_ 200 album, _The Youngbloods_. Its single "Get Together", did not sell well, reach number 62 on the _Billboard_ Hot 100.[4] Rereleased in 1969, it peaked at number 5.[5]

In 1969, Corbitt left the Youngbloods for a solo career, before the band recorded the album _Elephant Mountain_. In 1971, Corbitt and former Youngbloods producer Charlie Daniels formed the duo Corbitt & Daniels.

For the Youngbloods, he wrote or co-wrote "Dreamer's Dream" (with Levinger) and "Don't Play Games" (on the 1967 album _Earth Music_), "Rain Song (Don't Let the Rain Bring You Down)" (with Felix Pappalardi and Gail Collins Pappalardi) (on the 1969 album _Elephant Mountain_). His song "Life Goes On" (co-wtitten with Charlie Daniels) was included on the 1970 album _Charlie Daniels_. He also co-wrote "Insane in the Brain", by Cypress Hill (number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1993).

Corbitt played electric guitar and acoustic guitar on the 1971 debut album by the Canadian singer-songwriter David Wiffen, entitled _David Wiffen_.

Corbitt played bass guitar and produced Don McLean's 1970 debut album, Tapestry.[6]
