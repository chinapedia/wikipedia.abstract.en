1,3-DIFLUORO-TRISULFANE-1,1-DIFLUORIDE is an inorganic molecular substance consisting of sulfur in a low oxidation state with fluorine. The structural formula is SF₃SSF containing a chain of three sulfur atoms. At one end there are three fluorine atoms bound, and at the other one. The formula can also be written S₃F₄. It has a melting point of -62°C and a boiling point of 94°C. As a gas, it is unstable and breaks up to form SSF₂ and SF₄.[1]

SF₃SSF is produced by the condensation of sulfur difluoride and an isomer of SSF₂.[2] The reaction S₃F₄ SSF₂ + SF₂ uses 6 kJ/mol.[3]

Possible isomers of S₃F₄ include FSSF₂SF, which has a spontaneous fluorine migration to yield F₂SSSF₂ which in turn spontaneously fragments to SF₂ and SSF₂.[4]
