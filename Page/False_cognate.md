FALSE COGNATES are pairs of words that seem to be cognates because of similar sounds and meaning, but have different etymologies; they can be within the same language or from different languages, even within the same family. For example, the English word _dog_ and the Mbabaram word _dog_ have exactly the same meaning and very similar pronunciations, but by complete coincidence. Likewise, English _much_ and Spanish _mucho_ which came by their similar meanings via completely different Proto-Indo-European roots. This is different from false friends, which are similar-sounding words with different meanings, but which may in fact be etymologically related. (For example: Spanish _dependiente_ looks like _dependent_, but means sales assistant or clerk as well.)

Even though false cognates lack a common root, there may still be an indirect connection between them (for example by phono-semantic matching or folk etymology).


Phenomenon

The term "false cognate" is sometimes misused to refer to false friends, but the two phenomena are distinct. False friends occur when two words in different languages or dialects look similar, but have different meanings. While some false friends are also false cognates, many are genuine cognates (see False friends § Causes). For example, English _pretend_ and French _prétendre_ are false friends, but not false cognates, as they have the same origin.[1]
