Plot

Rick Wershe is a struggling single father living in 1980s Detroit during the height of the crack epidemic and war on drugs. His dissatisfied daughter, Dawn, leaves their home, leaving Rick alone with his son, Ricky. Rick manufactures gun parts and sells guns illegally to make ends meet. He involves his son in a sale of silenced AK-47s with local gangster, Johnny Curry. Ricky forms a bond with Johnny's son, Boo. The two become good friends which earns the favor of Johnny and his crew.

News of Rick's activity attracts attention from the FBI and soon, two agents, Alex Snyder and Frank Byrd, come to his home to question him. They see his son as a potential asset due to his connections with the criminal underworld. They convince Ricky to become an undercover drug informant behind his father's back in exchange for money and immunity for his father. His involvement goes deeper as they ask him to sell drugs to keep up appearances. Ricky is captivated by the his new extravagant lifestyle. He eventually gains enough credibility to be considered a "legitimate" drug supplier.

Rick becomes suspicious of his son, and finds thousands of dollars in illicit cash underneath his bed. He confronts Ricky which causes a rift between them. While Ricky is meeting with Dawn at a diner one evening, his grandfather's car is stolen. The two go outside and open fire on the fleeing car, but are arrested. They are bailed out by Ricky's handlers. This arouses suspicion from Johnny.

At a party following a boxing match in Las Vegas, Johnny beats his rival, Leon Lucas, within an inch of his life with a bottle of champagne. Afterwards, he orders a drive-by at Lucas' home, killing one of his young sons. Ricky learns that the weapons used were the same AK-47s he sold to Johnny at the start of the film. Devastated by his involvement in the murder of a child, he keeps a low profile and mends his relationship with his father. Suspecting Ricky to be an informant, Johnny sends Nugg to his house, who shoots him in the stomach. While at the hospital, Snyder informs Ricky that they have enough to raid all of Johnny's safe houses. She asks Ricky to forget about the shooting in exchange for dropping all charges on his father.

A year later in 1986, Brenda Moore's brother tells Ricky that Brenda had a daughter named Keisha, and that he is the father. Rick and Ricky come over to see the child, who wins over the affection of both of them. Later on, they find Dawn at a drug house and forcibly take her home to detox. She eventually makes a full recovery after several days.

In 1987, Ricky goes back to selling crack and assumes the role that Johnny left behind, even going so far as having sex with his wife, Cathy. Rick discovers he has earned more than enough money to make his dad's dream of opening up a video store come true. FBI agents arrest Ricky and he is held on drug possession with intent to distribute which could land him a potential life sentence. Ricky's former handlers deny their relationship with Ricky, but promise they will try to get his sentence reduced if he cooperates on one last bust. Ricky has Cathy help him out with a large shipment of drugs, the FBI raid the deal, and arrest everyone involved. At his court hearing, Ricky is found guilty and is sentenced to life in prison. Rick confronts the two agents about their deal but they feign ignorance.

After another year, Dawn, Rick, and Keisha visit Ricky in prison. Rick tries to give his son hope but Ricky laments that his life is over. Rick tears up and apologizes for not being able to give him an easy life like he wanted.

The credits reveal that Ricky was imprisoned for over 30 years, holding the record for the longest prison term for a non-violent offender in the state of Michigan. He was finally released on parole in 2017. His father passed away in 2014. His daughter, Keisha, is now happily married with two sons. A voice recording of the real Ricky Wershe Jr. plays in the background, saying that nobody thought he should really be in prison, but that he was feeling happy and hopeful.
