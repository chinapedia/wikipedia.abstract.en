ETH (, uppercase: Ð, lowercase: Ð; also spelled EDH or EÐ) is a letter used in Old English, Middle English, Icelandic, Faroese (in which it is called _edd_), Elfdalian, and Vietnamese. It was also used in Scandinavia during the Middle Ages but was subsequently replaced with _dh_ and later _d_. It is often transliterated as _d_. The lowercase version has been adopted to represent a voiced dental fricative in the International Phonetic Alphabet.

In Old English, _ð_ (called __ by the Anglo-Saxons[1]) was used interchangeably with _þ_ to represent the Old English dental fricative phoneme , which exists in modern English phonology as the voiced and voiceless dental fricatives now spelled "th".

Unlike the runic letter þ, ð is a modified Roman letter. ð was not found in the earliest records of Old English. A study of Mercian royal diplomas found that ð (along with đ) began to emerge in the early 8th century, with ð becoming strongly preferred by the 780s.[2] Another source indicates that the letter is "derived from Irish writing".[3]

The lowercase version has retained the curved shape of a medieval scribe's _d_, which _d_ itself in general has not. _ð_ was used throughout the Anglo-Saxon era but gradually fell out of use in Middle English, practically disappearing altogether by 1300;[4] _þ_ survived longer, ultimately being replaced by the digraph _th_.

In Icelandic, _ð_ represents a voiced dental fricative , which is the same as the _th_ in English _THat_, but it never appears as the first letter of a word, where _þ_ is used in its stead. The name of the letter is pronounced in isolation (and before words beginning with a voiceless consonant) as and therefore with a voiceless rather than voiced fricative.

In Faroese, _ð_ is not assigned to any particular phoneme and appears mostly for etymological reasons; however, it does show where most of the Faroese glides are; when _ð_ appears before _r_, it is, in a few words, pronounced . In the Icelandic and Faroese alphabets, _ð_ follows _d_.

In Vietnamese, Ð represents a [[voiced_alveolar_stop|[d] sound]] roughly similar to the D in English, as in dog. The uppercase is written the same as in every other language, however the lowercase is written as Đ, identical to a modern lowercase d except with a stroke.

In Olav Jakobsen Høyem's version of based on , _ð_ was always silent and was introduced for etymological reasons.

_Ð_ has also been used by some in written Welsh to represent , which is normally represented as _dd_.[5]

Modern uses

-   The letter _ð_ is sometimes used in mathematics and engineering textbooks as a symbol for a spin-weighted partial derivative. This operator gives rise to spin-weighted spherical harmonics.
-   A capital eth is used as the currency symbol for Dogecoin.[9]
