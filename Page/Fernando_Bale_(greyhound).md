FERNANDO BALE (born December 3, 2013) is a retired Australian greyhound whom many in Australia thought to be the greatest greyhound racer in Australia.


Appearance

Fernando Bale was mostly white in color with most of his body and legs white. But he also had a brindle rump and face (except a white stripe in the middle of his face).


Career

His first victory was 525Â m Maiden special weight at the Meadows. After two further wins he won his first of seven G1 races in the National Derby at Wentworth Park. After the Ballarat derby Fernando won the G1 Golden Easter Egg. His last two G1 wins were in the Adelaide Cup at Angle Park and the Top Gun at the Meadows. He kept running, and even tried to win another G1 in the Melbourne cup Final and was nosed out. He then won the G2 Ballarat final and a free-for-all before injury took him to stud.
