_FAITHFUL_ is an album by Polish jazz pianist and composer Marcin Wasilewski recorded in 2010 and released on the ECM label.[1][2][3]


Reception

In JazzTimes Brent Burton wrote "Turn it up loud or turn it down low; either way, it’s one of the best piano-trio recordings you’ll hear this year".[4] The Guardian critic John Fordham observed "Like their earlier ECM albums _Trio_ and _January_, _Faithful_ is predominantly pensive, but the trio are vivacious even while dreamwalking".[5] On _All About Jazz_ John Kelman noted "Wasilewski may be the titular leader, and contribute all the original material, but _Faithful_ clearly relies entirely on the strength of a collective for whom lyricism is paramount, regardless of the context—direct and driven or implicit and suggestive, but always placing the whole as the objective beyond its individual contributing voices".[6]
