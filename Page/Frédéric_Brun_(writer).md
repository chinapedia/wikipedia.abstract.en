FRÉDÉRIC BRUN (born 30 June 1960, Paris) is a French writer, the author of a trilogy published by Stock which earned him several literary prizes, including the prix Goncourt du premier roman for _Perla_, as well as the one bestowed by the "Association Écritures et Spiritualités" for _Une prière pour Nacha_.


Biography

In 2007, he published his first book _Perla_. Shortly after the death of his mother, Perla, deported fifty years earlier to the Auschwitz concentration camp, he tried to understand her ordeal and read numerous testimonies about the camps. Strangely at the same moment, he felt attracted by the German poets, Novalis, Hölderlin, Friedrich Schlegel and painter Caspar David Friedrich. A hymn to the mother, it is also a book of correspondence and questioning, on love, death, birth and transmission.[1]

In 2008, a second book was published: _Le Roman de Jean_. In this book, he retraces the journey of his father Jean Dréjac, author of songs, from fragments and rough drafts. After his disappearance, faced with questions about the afterlife, he finds an appeasement with the ancient philosophers.

In 2010, he completed a family trilogy with _Une prière pour Nacha_. Nacha suffers from Alzheimer's disease. At the moment when he was present at the end of her life, the narrator noticed that the story of his family's branch had not been told to him. He is going to make an investigation in Poland and thanks to a Yizker-bukh, a book of memory, he would get to know some details of the life of his ancestors. _Une prière pour Nacha_ is a book of hope at the crossroads of religions.

In 2015, he published the biographical novel _Novalis et l'âme poétique du monde_ and created the éditions Poesis. That same year, he was a member of the Prix Françoise Sagan.

In 2016, he conceived the design, the choice of texts and the foreword of the anthology _Habiter poétiquement le monde_ (Poesis).
