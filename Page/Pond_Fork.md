POND FORK (also called PONDFORK CREEK) is a stream in western Ozark County, Missouri.[1] Pond Fork has its source in the northwest corner of Ozark County and flows south-southeast passing under Missouri Route 95 between Thornfield and Longrun to its mouth at the northern branch of Bull Shoals Lake just northeast of Theodosia.[2][3] Prior to the filling of Bull Shoals, Pond Fork was a tributary to the Little North Fork White River which it joined just north of Theodosia.[4]

Pond Fork was named for the fact the creek is fed from a pond in its headwaters.[5]
