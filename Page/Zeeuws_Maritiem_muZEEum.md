The ZEEUWS MARITIME MUZEEUM is a maritime museum in the center of Vlissingen, situated on the marina of the city. It is the successor of the Stedelijk Museum in Vlissingen. It is housed in a building once owned by the Lampsins family, prominent in the shipping business in the 17th century.


Building

The muZEEum is housed in a building complex with buildings from the 16th, 17th, 18th and 21st century. These buildings are connected by modern architecture. One of the main parts of the complex is the Lampsinshuis. The Zeeland merchant Cornelis Lampsins had this house built in the then new style of Dutch Classicism in 1641 on the English Quay (now Nieuwendijk). He moved into it as a residence, but also established the office of the renowned trading house _Lampsins_ which among other things employed Michiel de Ruyter,[1] at the age of 12, in the function as Roper. Behind the Lampsinshuis is also the original warehouses of the City Palace that are also this part of the complex. In 2002 the construction began of this complex, designed by RGD Architect Marc van Roosmalen.

In the "Lampsinshuis' the permanent collection is displayed in the Zeeland maritime history. It is organised in the structured layer way of looking at History developed by Fernand Braudel. On each floor can be found this classified theme. The four levels are also arranged thematically as _Water_, _Work_, _Glory_ and _Adventure_.[2]

The Warehouses are temporary exhibitions hosting work by a top regional artist. In addition, the muZEEum has one smaller exhibition hall the "Schelde Hall" where temporary exhibitions are exhibited with a local maritime character.

The museum brasserie _Gecroonde Love_ is named after one of the ships of Michiel de Ruyter.
