RADSTOCK WEST RAILWAY STATION was a station on the Bristol and North Somerset Railway in the county of Bath and North East Somerset in England.


History

Opened as Radstock on 3 September 1873,[1] it was located immediately to the southwest of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway's (1874-1966). The station was renamed _Radstock West_ on 26 September 1949, and closed on 2 November 1959.[2][3]. Concurrently with the closure of the S&DJR on 7 March 1966, a connection was made to the S&DJR. This allowed trains on the former B&NSR to traverse a short spur through Radstock North to the Lower Writhlington, Braysdown and Writhlington collieries, to transport coal to Portishead power station. After the last coal from the Somerset Coalfield was extracted from Writhlington Colliery on 28 September 1973, the spur was dismantled.
