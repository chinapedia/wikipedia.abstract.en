ELISABETH (LIS) JACOBSEN, née RUBIN, (1882–1961) was a Danish philologist, archaeologist and writer. She is remembered first and foremost for her research and publications on the history of the Danish language but she was also an expert runologist who published a comprehensive analysis of all known runic inscriptions in Denmark. From 1911, Jacobsen played a major role in all fields of research related to the Danish language.[1][2]


Early life and education

Born on 29 January 1882 in Copenhagen, Jacobsen grew up in a rich Jewish family, the daughter of Marcus Rubin (1854–1923), director of the National Bank of Denmark, and his wife Kaja Davidsen (1854–1909).[3] After matriculating from N. Zahle's School in 1900, she qualified as a schoolteacher in 1903. The same year she married the historian Jacob Peter Jacobsen. In 1904, she began to study Scandinavian philology at Copenhagen University where she was awarded the university's gold medal for her 1907 essay _Naar og hvorledes har det fællesnordiske Sprog spaltet sig i forskellige Grene_ (When and how the common Nordic language broke up into different branches). After receiving her master's degree in 1908, in 1910 she became Denmark's first woman to earn a doctorate in Nordic philology with a thesis titled _Studier til det danske Rigssprogs Historie fra Eriks Lov til Chr. III.s Bibel_ (Studies on the History of the Danish Language from Erik's Law to Christian III's Bible).[4][5]


Career

Realizing the limitations of further research into the Danish language owing to the absence of adequate texts and dictionaries, in 1911, thanks to the support of Kristian Erslev and Carl S. Petersen, she founded _Det danske sprog- og litteraturselskab_ or DSL (Danish Society for Language and Literature) which she headed until 1931, whereafter she served as administrator. DSL gained importance through the publication of Jacobsen's numerous works.[6][7]

In collaboration with Harald Juul-Jensen (1982–1949), Jacobsen organized the work of publishing a comprehensive Danish dictionary, _Ordbog over det Danske Sprog_ which appeared in 28 volumes from 1919 to 1956. As a result of her interest in runes, thanks to the support of the Carlsberg Foundation and in collaboration with Erik Moltke, _Danmarks Runeindskrifter_ (Denmark's Runic Inscriptions) was published in 1942, covering descriptions, illustrations, a lexicon and an atlas with photographs.[8]

After the Second World War, Jacobsen continued to organize and initiate the creation of other important works, including _Nordisk Kultur_ (Nordic Culture) and _Kulturhistorisk Leksikon for nordisk Middelalder_ (Encyclopedia of Medieval Scandinavia), completed in 1979. In 1952, she launched work on the popular _Nudansk Ordbog_ (Dictionary of Modern Danish) and, in 1957, on _Synonymordbogen_ (Synonym Dictionary).[9][10]

Lis Jacobsen died in Hellerup on 18 June 1961 and is buried in Sindbjerg near Vejle.[11] Her husband died from tuberculosis in 1918, leaving her two teenager daughter, one born deaf.[12]
