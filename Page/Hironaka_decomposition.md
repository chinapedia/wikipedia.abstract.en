In mathematics, a HIRONAKA DECOMPOSITION is a representation of an algebra over a field as a finitely generated free module over a polynomial subalgebra or regular local ring. They are named after Heisuke Hironaka, who used this in his unpublished master's thesis at Kyoto University .

HIRONAKA'S CRITERION , sometimes called MIRACLE FLATNESS, states that a local ring _R_ that is a finite module over a regular Noetherian local ring _S_ is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if it is a free module over _S_. There is a similar result for rings that are graded over a field rather than local.
