_LIGHT WITHOUT HEAT_ () is a five-act play by Alexander Ostrovsky, based upon the play _The Broken Happiness_ by his friend, a fellow dramatist , which Ostrovsky re-worked. It premiered at the Moscow Maly Theatre on 6 November 1880 (as a benefit for Mikhail Sadovsky who played Rabachev) and first appeared in print in 1881, in _Ogonyok_ magazines (issues 6-10), as the Ostrovsky and Solovyov's joint work.

Modern Russian critics see it as a precursor to Anton Chekhov's _The Cherry Orchard_, both plays focusing on the Russian gentry at different stages of its decline or, in case of Chekhov's play, collapse.[1]


Background

Nikolai_Solovyev.JPG In May 1880 Nikolai Solovyov approached Ostrovsky with the idea of writing a play together and suggested they should take as a basis his newly written piece called _Broken Happiness_ (Разбитое счастье). In early August Solovyov brought the rough copy of his version to Shchelykovo, the Ostrovskys' estate. "I've just finished Act 1. We need not hurry. After the success of _[The Marriage of] Belugin_ and _The Wild One_ we have to put all our energy into this single work," Ostrovsky wrote him later this month, referring to the two plays they had recently co-authored and saw being staged.

What he did then was reject the original title, as well as the next one, _Na Rodine_ (In the Native Place). On 2 October he wrote to Solovyov: "We cannot hit upon the proper title, what could this mean? Only that the play's leitmotif remains unclear even to ourselves. The plotline is still underdeveloped... and even the main question remains unanswered: what the play purports to say exactly?" He continued: "Ozerskoy[2] is a hot-headed man, not very intelligent and somewhat primitive. His love for Olya amounts to little more than a sensual instinct. Only in the Act 4 it dawns upon him all of a sudden that his life with Olya will be as dreary as Zavalishin's life with his wife. So there it is, the core of his personal drama. He is torn between two women: one superior to him, another inferior. He rejects the latter and gets rejected by the former."

Finally in this letter, Ostrovsky suggested another title: "The play should be called _Light Without Heat_. Renyova only lightens for them their swamp of a life, giving nothing at all. It highlights the play's main conflict. For Zavalishin and [Rabachev] she lightens their respective lives, but gives neither of them any warmth. The former, crashed by apathy, sinks into his personal mire. The latter, an impulsive one, literally throws himself off the cliff."[3]

Of the total 182 pages of the play's handwritten manuscript everything starting with page 50 has been written by Solovyov. Ostrovsky has made numerous cuts and additions to this final draft, dealing mostly with the characters' language, to make it more laconic and expressive. He re-worked several episodes he considered vital either for the play's structure or for properly portraying its characters, as well as the finales of all the five acts. Completely re-worked by Ostrovsky was the central scene of the Act 3, depicting the emotionally charged dialogue between Rabachev and Olya.[4]

Production history

_Light Without Heat_ was premiered in Moscow's Maly Theatre on 1880, as a benefit for the actor Mikhail Sadovsky who played Rabachev. Also performing were Nadezhda Nikulina (Renyova), Maria Yermolova (Olya), Olga Sadovskaya (Zaleshina), Vladimir Maksheyev (Zaleshin) and Nikolai Muzil (Khudobayev).

The general response to the premiere was negative. "That's what comes out of having no final rehearsal. The second performance will be better and the whole thing will just grow," wrote Ostrovsky to his friend, the actor Fyodor Burdin. He proved to be right. "The 4th performance was sold out, and the response was excellent," wrote Ostrovsky in a 20 November letter to Solovyov.

On 14 November _Light Without Heat_ was performed at the Alexandrinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, as a benefit for Burdin who played Khudobayev. Among other actors involved were Antonina Abarinova (Renyova), Maria Savina (Olya), Nikolai Sazonov (Rabachev), Vladimir Davydov (Deryugin) and Alexander Nilsky (Zaleshin). "Here the cast was superb and the public greatly enjoyed it, the premiere was a furor and the second performance even better," Solovyov informed Ostrovsky.

In December 1894 _Light Without Heat_ opened at the Society of Art and Literature. Cast included Konstantin Stanislavski as Rabachev[7] and Maria Andreyeva who made her stage debut as Olya Vasilkova.[8]
