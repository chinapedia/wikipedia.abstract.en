BEN LUKAS BOYSEN, also known by his stage name HECQ, is an electronic music composer based in Berlin.[1]


Biography

Boysen learned classical guitar and piano as a child.[2] He moved to Berlin in the early 2000s, setting up a studio called Hecq Audio,[3] and composed electronic music under the alias Hecq[4] from 2003. As Hecq, he released music in a variety of electronic styles, including glitch, ambient, breakcore, abstract IDM, and dubstep, mostly on the label Hymen Records.[5]

In 2014, he was featured (under his given name) in the lead track of Jon Hopkins's _LateNightTales_ release.[6] He signed with Erased Tapes and released two full-lengths to date as Ben Lukas Boysen. The first, _Gravity_, was originally issued in 2013, but was reissued by Erased Tapes in 2016; the second, _Spells_, appeared in 2016 as well.[7][8]

Boysen also does soundtrack work and has written pieces for entities such as Marvel and Amnesty International.[9]
