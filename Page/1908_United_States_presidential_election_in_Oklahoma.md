The 1908 UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN OKLAHOMA took place on November 3, 1908. All 46 states were part of the 1908 United States presidential election. Oklahoma voters chose 7 electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. This was the first presidential election Oklahoma participated in.

Democratic Nominee William Jennings Bryan won Oklahoma by a 4.66% margin of victory.[1] Oklahoma became a reliably Democratic state, with the party nominee winning 10 out of the first 15 elections held in the state. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson became the last Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state.[2]

Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist candidate, won 8.52% of the vote, demonstrating the strength of the Socialist movement in Oklahoma at this point in the state's history. Debs would go on to improve this performance in 1912, winning around twice as much of the percentage of the vote in Oklahoma.
