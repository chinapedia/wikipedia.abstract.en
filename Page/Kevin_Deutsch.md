Author_and_Crime_Journalist_Kevin_Deutsch.jpg KEVIN DEUTSCH is an American criminal justice journalist, author of two books, and host of the crime podcast "A Dark Turn" on the Authors on the Air Global Radio Network.[1] He is currently a staff writer for the criminal justice nonprofit _Bronx Justice News._[2] The sourcing and veracity of some of his news articles and his book _Pill City_ became the subject of a high-profile dispute in 2017 involving allegations made by members of the media that Deutsch fabricated sources. [3] [4] [5] Deutsch denied all of the claims and defended his work as accurate, as did his publisher, St. Martins Press.[6] Deutsch was never formally accused by any major news organization of fabricating sources.[7]_Pill City_ is an account of how two teens used opioids looted during the 2015 Baltimore riots to sell drugs using an Uber-like app and founded a nationwide criminal syndicate.[8][9]


Career

Deutsch's first book, _The Triangle: A Year on the Ground with New York's Bloods and Crips_,[10] is an account of the year the author spent covering a Bloods-Crips gang war on Long Island.[11][12][13][14][15][16] It received positive reviews from critics, including a starred review from _Publisher's Weekly_ magazine. His second book, _Pill City: How Two Honor Roll Students Foiled the Feds and Built a Drug Empire_,[17] chronicles the story of how opiates stolen during the Baltimore riots sparked a wave of inner-city addiction and violence.[18] It received a starred review from Booklist magazine.[19] Deutsch, born Kevin Shulman, writes under his father’s name. He received a Sunshine State Award for travel writing for a story he wrote about his deceased father, attorney Howard Shulman.[20]

Deutsch has worked on staff at _Newsday_,[21] _The New York Daily News_,[22][23] _The Miami Herald_,[24] _The Palm Beach Post_,[25] and _The Riverdale Press_.[26] His work as a freelancer has also appeared in _The New York Times_,[27] _Newsweek_,[28] _The Village Voice_,[29] _The Forward_,[30] _Columbia Journalism Review_,[31] and _The New York Post_.[32] Deutsch has been interviewed about American street gangs and drug trafficking,[33][34][35][36][37] and has received prizes for his writing about crime and national news events, including an Associated Press award for justice beat reporting.[38]


Questions about sources

Deutsch "was never formally accused by any major news organization of fabricating sources," but some journalists made allegations of fabrication following the release of Deutsch's second book, _Pill City_. Shortly after the book's release, reporters from _The Baltimore Sun_ and _Baltimore City Paper_, challenged the veracity of the book's narrative.[39] On February 10, 2017, _The Baltimore Sun_ published an article quoting government officials that cast doubt on the book, and Deutsch's practice of changing the names of individuals and places he documented.[40] Core elements of the book could not be substantiated, including "the dates, circumstances and victims involved in homicides Deutsch describes in detail."[41] The _City Paper_ was not able to confirm the existence of almost any person described in the book, including incidental characters not involved in crime who would have no reason to fear exposure.[42] Despite a detailed explanation of events in the Shock Trauma department at the University of Maryland Medical Center, no record exists of Deutsch visiting it.[43] Of the murders described in the book, several did not appear to match any of Baltimore area's recorded murders during the year-long time period.[44] The _City Paper_, despite inquiring with both the police and other experts on the Baltimore underworld, was unable to verify the existence of characters who might possibly have been analogues for "old-school drug kingpin Jimmy Masters" nor a "nationally famous" Reverend Grier, despite a detailed description of a high-profile and well-attended funeral for Grier in the book.[45]

The _Baltimore Sun_ article also included an extended video interview with Deutsch, in which he defended his work and his use of anonymous sourcing, which he said was needed to protect the safety of interviewees.[46] The "Author's Note" in Deutsch's book includes a section detailing his methodology. It states that "In order to disguise the identities of interviewees, most of their names have been changed. For that same reason, certain locations, physical descriptions, and other identifying details have been altered or obscured." [47][48]

Within a week of the _Baltimore Sun_ story, both _Newsday_ and _The New York Times_ announced separate internal reviews of Deutsch's past writing.[49][50][51] Baltimore TV writer/producer David Simon said "After reading, I think this book is, by and large, a wholesale fabrication."[52][53]

On February 24, 2017, _The New York Times_ published an editors' note on the sole article Deutsch wrote for the paper, detailing its investigation and conclusion:

Following these findings, on March 2, 2017, the media watchdog group iMediaEthics confirmed that the _New York Daily News_ was conducting an internal review, examining all 572 stories from Deutsch's career with the company.[54][55] The group later shared a statement from _Newsweek_, confirming that it would review the three stories Deutsch had written there as well.[56] The _New York Daily News_ review was less extensive than the _Newsday_ review and noted the impossibility of verifying five-to-seven year old stories that were often written under multiple bylines after staff turnover, but did not find any obvious "red flags" in its review.[57][58] Deutsch has stood by all of his reporting, stating that he used the exact names given to him by his interviewees.[59]

On July 12, 2017, _Newsday_, where Deutsch was on staff for more than four years, released the conclusions of its review of Deutsch's writing there. _Newsday_ said that review was prompted by the Baltimore article questioning Deutsch's second book. _Newsday_ found that in 77 or more than 600 articles written by Deutsch, 109 individuals he quoted could not have their existence confirmed. The editors said the main points of the articles were confirmed and cited many reasons that people might not give a real name to a police reporter. No corrections were issued, but _Newsday_ appended individual editor's notes to each of the 77 articles online, detailing which sources it could not locate after approximately four months of effort.[60][61][62]

In response, Deutsch issued a statement on his website stating: "For me, journalistic ethics are sacrosanct. They've remained so throughout my fifteen-year criminal justice journalism career—a career I'm extremely proud of. I stand behind every word I've published. None of my work has been found to be inaccurate, nor any story I've worked on ever retracted. Newsday’s review confirmed the accuracy of the more than 630 stories I wrote for the paper--stories Newsday is standing behind."[63] Deutsch has also suggested that his competitors are simply jealous of his work.[64]

_The Washington Post_ and _Rolling Stone_ both published articles which noted that Deutsch had worked for news organizations for years before Deutsch's alleged sourcing problems were brought to light.[65] They both hypothesized that Deutsch's coverage of marginalized communities meant he faced less accountability.[66] Such sources are more difficult to track down, and readers are happy to accept information that fits their expectations. David Simon was more blunt; he wrote "Nobody is going to fact check poor black people. That's the bottom line... you can say anything you want about the black underclass."[67]

_Rolling Stone_ updated its story about Deutsch with a clarification in August 2018, stating that "This story has been changed to clarify that Deutsch was never formally accused by any major news organization of fabricating sources. It was also updated to include a comment from Deutsch." That comment read: “Despite the false and baseless accusations made by a handful of competing journalists who targeted some of my work, including the author of this very piece, none of the more than 1,500 news articles, briefs, features, or books I’ve published in my 16-year crime reporting career has ever been retracted, nor a single factual correction or clarification issued, as a result of these attacks.”[68]
