Killing Season}}

_THE KILLING SEASON_ is an American true crime documentary television series which debuted on November 12, 2016, on A&E. Executive produced by Alex Gibney, the series follows documentarians Joshua Zeman and Rachel Mills as they explore the case of the Long Island serial killer and other unsolved cases such as the Eastbound Strangler, and the victims and investigations that have been connected to the cases.[1] Some new investigating and interviewing is done during the series, including contacting internet amateur crime investigation group Websleuths.com group members, and following-up on Websleuths activities.[2]

Series producers found sex worker serial killings to be a bigger problem than they expected and they look for obstacles that law enforcement has in solving the murders.[3]
