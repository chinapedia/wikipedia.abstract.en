SPANISH PROVERBS are a subset of proverbs that are used in Western cultures in general; there are many that have essentially the same form and content as their counterparts in other Western languages. Proverbs that have their origin in Spanish have migrated to and from English, French, Flemish, German and other languages.


Origins

Many Spanish proverbs have a long history of cultural diffusion; there are proverbs, for example, that have their origin traced to Babylon and that have come down to us through Greece and Rome; equivalents of the Spanish proverb _“En boca cerrada no entran moscas”_ (Silence is golden) belong to the cultural tradition of many north-African countries as far as Ethiopia; having gone through multiple languages and millennia, this proverb can be traced back to an ancient Babylonian proverb.

The written evidence of the use of Spanish proverbs goes far back in Spanish literature. _El Cantar de Mio Cid_, written at the end of the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century, is the first instance. Examples of other early works that use Spanish proverbs are the _Libro de Buen Amor_ by Juan Ruiz (14th century) and _El Corbacho_ by Alfonso Martínez de Toledo (15th century). The first anthology of Spanish proverbs, _Proverbios que dicen las viejas tras el fuego_, was written by Íñigo López de Mendoza, Marques of Santillana (15th century). Also in the 15th century was written the _Seniloquium_, an erudite and anonymous work containing a compendium of Spanish sayings and proverbs with commentaries. The language of the characters in Fernando de Rojas’ _La Celestina_ (15th – 16th century) is enlivened with the use of proverbs. And then, of course, in the 17th century there is the incomparable _Don Quijote de la Mancha_ by Cervantes.

Sancho Panza, Cervantes’ wonderful, earthy, character, is the essential common man. His thinking habitually relies on the authority he vests in the wealth of popular cultural wisdom expressed in proverbs, which he continually quotes. In many of his utterances there is reference to one and sometimes to more proverbs. _Don Quijote_ is a veritable treasure trove of Spanish proverbs.

There are Spanish proverbs that contradict others; the “wisdom” that they encapsulate is not, of course, absolute. People will use those proverbs that best conform to their own particular way of approaching life. Taken together, however, they reveal the deep wellsprings of Spanish culture and of human nature in general.


Examples

        _Meaning/use:_

        _Comments:_

            According to some authors, for instance José Mª Sbarbi, this proverb has its origin in a historical episode involving Sancho II of Castile. When his father Ferdinand I of Leon and Castile at his death in 1065 divided up his kingdom among his three sons, including himself, Sancho II remained silent. Soon after his father's death, however, he turned on his brothers and succeeded in dispossessing them, reuniting thus his father's possessions under his control in 1072. The author Correas, however, sustains that _Sancho_ is used as a variation of the adjective _santo_ (saintly) and should therefore be written in lower-case.[1]
