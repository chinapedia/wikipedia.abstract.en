The 1929 IDAHO VANDALS FOOTBALL TEAM represented the University of Idaho in the 1929 college football season. The Vandals were led by first-year head coach Leo Calland and were in their eighth season in the Pacific Coast Conference. Home games were played on campus in Moscow at MacLean Field. Idaho compiled a 4–5 overall record and went in conference games.

Calland was previously a USC assistant coach and a former player for the Trojans,[1][2] a guard and captain as a senior on the 1922 team that won the Rose Bowl. Raised in Seattle, he was also the head coach of the USC basketball team for two seasons.[3][4]

In the Battle of the Palouse with neighbor Washington State, the Cougars won for the second straight year,[5][6] their first at home in Pullman in eight years.

The Vandals finished the season with a two-game road trip to Los Angeles and Pocatello in southeastern Idaho. Calland's return to USC was harsh, with a 72-point shutout by the Trojans to extend the season's losing streak to five games.[7] The final game on Thanksgiving was a 41–7 win over the Tigers of the university's Southern Branch,[8] today's Idaho State University, but then a two-year school.


Schedule

-   The Little Brown Stein trophy for the Montana game debuted nine years later in 1938

All-conference

No Vandals were named to the All-Coast team.[9][10] on the All-Northwest team, tackle Gordon Diehl and center Lester Kirkpatrick were first team selections.[11][12]
