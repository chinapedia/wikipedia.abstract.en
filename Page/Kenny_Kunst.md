International career

Kunst originally played for the Netherlands Antilles,[1] playing 3 games for the Under 20 side in the preliminary qualification rounds at the 2005 CONCACAF U-20 Tournament and scoring once.[2] He played 5 games in total for the senior squad, scoring once against Guyana in a 3-2 defeat at the 2010 Caribbean Cup qualification.[3]

Kunst has also represented the nation of Bonaire. As Bonaire are not recognised by FIFA, any matches played are unofficial. He played two matches in the 2011 ABCS Tournament, scoring both times. His goals came in a 3-1 victory over Curaçao[5] and in the final; a 2-2 draw with Aruba, which Bonaire went on to win 4-3 on penalties.[6]
