PETER EDWARD COOK (17 November 1937 – 9 January 1995) was an English satirist and comedic actor. He was a leading figure of the British satire boom of the 1960s, and associated with the Anti-Establishment comedic movement that emerged in the United Kingdom in the late 1950s.

Referred to as "the father of modern satire" by _The Guardian_ newspaper in 2005, Cook was ranked number one in the _Comedians' Comedian_, a poll of more than 300 comics, comedy writers, producers, and directors throughout the English-speaking world.[1][2]


Early life

Cook was born at his parents' house, "Shearbridge", in Middle Warberry Road, Torquay, Devon. He was the only son, and eldest of the three children, of Alexander Edward "Alec" Cook (1906–1984), a colonial civil servant and his wife Ethel Catherine Margaret (1908–1994), daughter of solicitor Charles Mayo.[3] His father served as political officer and later district officer in Nigeria, then as financial secretary to the colony of Gibraltar, followed by a return to Nigeria as Permanent Secretary of the Eastern Region based at Enugu.[4][5] Cook's grandfather, Edward Arthur Cook (1869-1914), had also been a colonial civil servant, traffic manager for the Federated Malay States Railway in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya; stress that he suffered, in the lead-up to an interview regarding promotion, led him to commit suicide. His wife, Minnie Jane (1869-1957; daughter of Thomas Wreford, of Thelbridge and Witheridge, Devon, and of Stratford-upon-Avon, of a prominent Devonshire family traced back to 1440),[6][7] kept this fact secret; Peter Cook only discovered the truth when later researching his family.[8]

Cook was educated at Radley College and then went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he studied French and German. As a student, Cook initially intended to become a career diplomat like his father, but Britain "had run out of colonies", as he put it.[9] Although largely apathetic politically, particularly in later life when he displayed a deep distrust of politicians of all hues, he joined the Cambridge University Liberal Club.[10] At Pembroke, Cook performed and wrote comedy sketches as a member of the Cambridge Footlights Club, of which he became president in 1960. His hero was fellow Footlights writer and Cambridge magazine writer David Nobbs.[11]

While still at university Cook wrote for Kenneth Williams, providing several sketches for Williams's hit West End comedy revue _Pieces of Eight_ and much of the follow-up, _One Over the Eight_, before finding prominence in his own right in a four-man group satirical stage show, _Beyond the Fringe_, alongside Jonathan Miller, Alan Bennett and Dudley Moore.[12]

_Beyond the Fringe_ became a great success in London after being first performed at the Edinburgh Festival and included Cook impersonating the prime minister, Harold Macmillan. This was one of the first occasions satirical political mimicry had been attempted in live theatre, and it shocked audiences. During one performance, Macmillan was in the theatre and Cook departed from his script and attacked him verbally.[13]


Career

1960s

'']]

In 1961, Cook opened The Establishment, a club at 18 Greek Street in Soho in central London, presenting fellow comedians in a nightclub setting, including American Lenny Bruce. Cook said it was a satirical venue modelled on "those wonderful Berlin cabarets ... which did so much to stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the outbreak of the Second World War";[14] as a members-only venue it was outside the censorship restrictions. The Establishment's regular cabaret performers were Eleanor Bron, John Bird and John Fortune.[15]

Cook befriended and supported Australian comedian and actor Barry Humphries, who began his British solo career at the club. Humphries said in his autobiography, _My Life As Me_, that he found Cook's lack of interest in art and literature off-putting. Dudley Moore's jazz trio played in the basement of the club during the early 1960s.

Cook also opened an Establishment club in New York in 1963 and Lenny Bruce performed there, as well.[16]

In 1962, the BBC commissioned a pilot for a television series of satirical sketches based on the Establishment Club, but it was not immediately picked up and Cook went to New York City for a year to perform _Beyond The Fringe_ on Broadway. When he returned, the pilot had been refashioned as _That Was the Week That Was_ and had made a star of David Frost, something Cook resented.

The 1960s satire boom was coming to an end and Cook said: "England was about to sink giggling into the sea."[17] He complained that Frost's success was based on copying Cook's own stage persona and Cook dubbed him "the bubonic plagiarist",[18] and said that his only regret in life, according to Alan Bennett, had been saving Frost from drowning. This incident occurred in the summer of 1963, when the rivalry between the two men was at its height. Cook had realised that Frost's potential drowning would have looked deliberate if he had not been rescued.[19]

Around this time, Cook provided financial backing for the satirical magazine _Private Eye_, supporting it through difficult periods, particularly in libel trials. Cook invested his own money and solicited investment from his friends. For a time, the magazine was produced from the premises of the Establishment Club. In 1963, Cook married Wendy Snowden; the couple had two daughters, Lucy and Daisy, but the marriage ended in 1970.

Cook's first regular television spot was on Granada Television's _Braden Beat_ with Bernard Braden, where he featured his most enduring character: the static, dour and monotonal E. L. Wisty, whom Cook had conceived for Radley College's Marionette Society.

in London for the US television programme _Kraft Music Hall_]]

Cook's comedy partnership with Dudley Moore led to _Not Only... But Also_. This was originally intended by the BBC as a vehicle for Moore's music, but Moore invited Cook to write sketches and appear with him. Using few props, they created dry, absurd television that proved hugely popular and lasted for three series between 1965 and 1970. Cook played characters such as Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling and the two men created their Pete and Dud alter egos. Other sketches included "Superthunderstingcar", a parody of the Gerry Anderson marionette TV shows, and Cook's pastiche of 1960s trendy arts documentaries – satirised in a parodic segment on Greta Garbo.

When Cook learned a few years later that the videotapes of the series were to be wiped, a common practice at the time, he offered to buy the recordings from the BBC but was refused because of copyright issues. He suggested he could purchase new tapes so that the BBC would have no need to erase the originals, but this was also turned down. Of the original 22 programmes, only eight still survive complete. A compilation of six half-hour programmes, _The Best of What's Left of Not Only...But Also_ was shown on television and has been released on both VHS and DVD.

With _The Wrong Box_ (1966) and _Bedazzled_ (1967) Cook and Moore began to act in films together. Directed by Stanley Donen, the underlying story of _Bedazzled_ is credited to Cook and Moore and its screenplay to Cook. A comic parody of Faust, it stars Cook as George Spigott (the Devil) who tempts Stanley Moon (Moore), a frustrated, short-order chef, with the promise of gaining his heart's desire – the unattainable beauty and waitress at his cafe, Margaret Spencer (Eleanor Bron) – in exchange for his soul, but repeatedly tricks him. The film features cameo appearances by Barry Humphries as Envy and Raquel Welch as Lust. Moore composed the soundtrack music and co-wrote (with Cook) the songs performed in the film. His jazz trio backed Cook on the theme, a parodic anti-love song, which Cook delivered in a deadpan monotone and included his familiar put-down, "you fill me with inertia".

In 1968, Cook and Moore briefly switched to ATV for four one-hour programmes titled _Goodbye Again_, based on the Pete and Dud characters. Cook's increasing alcoholism led him to become reliant on cue cards; the show was not a popular success, owing in part to a strike causing the suspension of the publication of the ITV listings magazine _TV Times_. John Cleese was a cast member.

1970s

]] In 1970, Cook took over a project initiated by David Frost for a satirical film about an opinion pollster who rises to become President of Great Britain. Under Cook's guidance, the character became modelled on Frost. The film, _The Rise and Rise of Michael Rimmer_, was not a success, although the cast contained notable names (including Monty Python's John Cleese and Graham Chapman, who co-wrote the film).

Cook became a favourite of the chat show circuit, but his own effort at hosting such a show for the BBC in 1971, _Where Do I Sit?_, was said by the critics to have been a disappointment. He was replaced after only two episodes by Michael Parkinson, the start of Parkinson's career as a chat show host. Parkinson later asked Cook what his ambitions were, Cook replied jocularly "[...] in fact, my ambition is to shut you up altogether you see!"[20]

Cook and Moore fashioned sketches from _Not Only....But Also_ and _Goodbye Again_ with new material into the stage revue called _Behind the Fridge_. This show toured Australia in 1972 before transferring to New York City in 1973, re-titled as _Good Evening_. Cook frequently appeared on and off stage the worse for drink. Nonetheless, the show proved very popular and it won Tony and Grammy Awards. When it finished, Moore stayed in the United States to pursue his film acting ambitions in Hollywood. Cook returned to Britain and in 1973 married the actress and model Judy Huxtable.

Later, the more risqué humour of Pete and Dud went farther on long-playing records as "Derek and Clive". The first recording was initiated by Cook to alleviate boredom during the Broadway run of _Good Evening_, and used material conceived years before for the two characters but considered too outrageous. One of these audio recordings was also filmed, and therein tensions between the duo are seen to rise. Chris Blackwell circulated bootleg copies to friends in the music business. The popularity of the recording convinced Cook to release it commercially, although Moore was initially reluctant, fearing that his rising fame as a Hollywood star would be undermined. Two further _Derek and Clive_ albums were released, the last accompanied by a film.

Cook and Moore hosted _Saturday Night Live_ on 24 January 1976 during the show's first season. They did a number of their classic stage routines, including "One Leg Too Few" and "Frog and Peach" among others, in addition to participating in some skits with the show's ensemble cast.

In 1978, Cook appeared on the British music series _Revolver_ as the manager of a ballroom where emerging punk and new wave acts played. For some groups, these were their first appearances on television. Cook's acerbic commentary was a distinctive aspect of the programme.

In 1979, Cook recorded comedy-segments as B-sides to the Sparks 12-inch singles "Number One Song in Heaven" and "Tryouts for the Human Race". The main songwriter Ron Mael often began with a banal situation in his lyrics, and then went at surreal tangents in the style of Cook and S. J. Perelman.

_Consequences_ album

Cook played multiple roles on the 1977 concept album _Consequences_, written and produced by former 10cc members Kevin Godley and Lol Creme. A mixture of spoken comedy and progressive rock with an environmental subtext, _Consequences_ started as a single that Godley and Creme planned to make to demonstrate their invention, an electric guitar effect called the Gizmo, which they developed in 10cc. The project grew into a three-LP box set. The comedy sections were originally intended to be performed by a cast including Spike Milligan and Peter Ustinov, but Godley and Creme eventually settled on Cook once they realised he could perform most parts himself.

The storyline centres on the impending divorce of ineffectual Englishman Walter Stapleton (Cook) and his French wife Lulu (Judy Huxtable). While meeting their lawyers – the bibulous Mr. Haig and overbearing Mr. Pepperman (both played by Cook) – the encroaching global catastrophe interrupts proceedings with bizarre and mysterious happenings, which seem to centre on Mr. Blint (Cook), a musician and composer living in the flat below Haig's office, to which it is connected by a large hole in the floor.

Although it has since developed a cult following due to Cook's presence, _Consequences_ was released as punk was sweeping the UK and proved a resounding commercial failure, savaged by critics who found the music self-indulgent. The script and story have evident connections to Cook's own life – his then wife Judy Huxtable plays Walter's wife. Cook's struggles with alcohol are mirrored in Haig's drinking, and there is a parallel between the fictional divorce of Walter and Lulu and Cook's own divorce from his first wife. The voice and accent Cook used for the character of Stapleton are similar to those of Cook's _Beyond the Fringe_ colleague, Alan Bennett, and a book on Cook's comedy, _How Very Interesting_, speculates that the characters Cook plays in _Consequences_ are caricatures of the four _Beyond The Fringe_ cast members – the alcoholic Haig represents Cook, the tremulous Stapleton is Bennett, the parodically Jewish Pepperman is Miller, and the pianist Blint represents Moore.[21]

Amnesty International performances

Cook appeared at the first three fund-raising galas staged by humorists John Cleese and Martin Lewis on behalf of Amnesty International. The benefits were dubbed _The Secret Policeman's Balls_, though it wasn't until the third show in 1979 that the title was used. He performed on all three nights of the first show in April 1976, _A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)_, as an individual performer and as a member of the cast of _Beyond the Fringe_, which reunited for the first time since the 1960s. He also appeared in a Monty Python sketch, taking the place of Eric Idle. Cook was on the cast album of the show and in the film, _Pleasure at Her Majesty's_. He was in the second Amnesty gala in May 1977, _An Evening Without Sir Bernard Miles_. It was retitled _The Mermaid Frolics_ for the cast album and TV special. Cook performed monologues and skits with Terry Jones.

In June 1979, Cook performed all four nights of _The Secret Policeman's Ball_, teaming with John Cleese. Cook performed a couple of solo pieces and a sketch with Eleanor Bron. He also led the ensemble in the finale – the "End of the World" sketch from _Beyond The Fringe_.

In response to a barb in _The Daily Telegraph_ that the show was recycled material, Cook wrote a satire of the summing-up by Mr Justice Cantley in the trial of former Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe, a summary now widely thought to show bias in favour of Thorpe. Cook performed it that same night (Friday 29 June – the third of the four nights) and the following night. The nine-minute opus, "Entirely a Matter for You", is considered by many fans and critics to be one of the finest works of Cook's career. Along with Cook, producer of the show Martin Lewis brought out an album on Virgin Records entitled _Here Comes the Judge: Live_, containing the live performance together with three studio tracks that further lampooned the Thorpe trial.[22]

Although unable to take part in the 1981 gala, Cook supplied the narration over the animated opening title sequence of the 1982 film of the show. With Lewis, he wrote and voiced radio commercials to advertise the film in the UK. He also hosted a spoof film awards ceremony that was part of the world première of the film in London in March 1982.

Following Cook's 1987 stage reunion with Moore for the annual American benefit for the homeless, _Comic Relief_ (not related to the UK _Comic Relief_ benefits), Cook repeated the reunion for a British audience by performing with Moore at the 1989 Amnesty benefit _The Secret Policeman's Biggest Ball_.

1980s

Cook starred in the LWT special _Peter Cook & Co._ in 1980. The show included comedy sketches, including a _Tales of the Unexpected_ parody "Tales of the Much As We Expected". This involved Cook as Roald Dahl, explaining his name had been Ronald before he dropped the "n". The cast included John Cleese, Rowan Atkinson, Beryl Reid, Paula Wilcox and Terry Jones. Partly spurred by Moore's growing film star status, Cook moved to Hollywood in that year, and appeared as an uptight English butler to a wealthy American woman in a short-lived United States television sitcom, _The Two of Us_, also making cameo appearances in a couple of undistinguished films.

In 1983, Cook played the role of Richard III in the first episode of _Blackadder_, "The Foretelling", which parodies Laurence Olivier's portrayal. In 1984, he played the role of Nigel, the mathematics teacher, in Jeannot Szwarc's film _Supergirl_, working alongside the evil Selena played by Faye Dunaway. He then narrated the short film _Diplomatix_ by Norwegian comedy trio Kirkvaag, Lystad and Mjøen, which won the "Special Prize of the City of Montreux" at the Montreux Comedy Festival in 1985. In 1986 he partnered Joan Rivers on her UK talk show. He appeared as Mr Jolly in 1987 in _The Comic Strip Presents_' episode "Mr. Jolly Lives Next Door", playing an assassin who covers the sound of his murders by playing Tom Jones records. That same year, Cook appeared in _The Princess Bride_ as the "Impressive Clergyman" who officiates at the wedding ceremony between Buttercup and Prince Humperdinck, uttering the now-famous line "Mawage!" Also that year, he spent time working with humourist Martin Lewis on a political satire about the 1988 US presidential elections for HBO, but the script went unproduced. Lewis suggested that Cook team with Moore for the US _Comic Relief_ telethon for the homeless. The duo reunited and performed their "One Leg Too Few" sketch.

In 1988, Cook appeared as a contestant on the improvisation comedy show _Whose Line Is It Anyway?_. He was declared the winner, his prize being to read the credits in the style of a New York cab driver – a character he had portrayed in _Peter Cook & Co._

Cook occasionally called in to Clive Bull's night-time phone-in radio show on LBC in London. Using the name "Sven from Swiss Cottage", he mused on love, loneliness and herrings in a mock Norwegian accent. Jokes included Sven's attempts to find his estranged wife, in which he often claimed to be telephoning the show from all over the world, and his hatred of the Norwegian obsession with fish. While Bull was clearly aware that Sven was fictional, he did not learn of the caller's real identity until later.

Revival

In late 1989, Cook married for the third time, to Malaysian-born property developer Chiew Lin Chong (1945–2016), in Torbay, Devon. She provided him with some stability in his personal life, and he reduced his drinking to the extent that for a time he was teetotal. He lived alone in a small 18th-century house in Perrins Walk, Hampstead, while she kept her own property just 100 yards away.

Cook returned to the BBC as Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling for an appearance with Ludovic Kennedy in _A Life in Pieces_. The 12 interviews saw Sir Arthur recount his life, based on the song "Twelve Days of Christmas". Unscripted interviews with Cook as Streeb-Greebling and satirist Chris Morris were recorded in late 1993 and broadcast as _Why Bother?_ on BBC Radio 3. Morris described them:

On 17 December 1993, Cook appeared on _Clive Anderson Talks Back_ as four characters – biscuit tester and alien abductee Norman House, football manager and motivational speaker Alan Latchley, judge Sir James Beauchamp, and rock legend Eric Daley. The following day, he appeared on BBC2 performing links for _Arena_'s "Radio Night". He also appeared in the 1993 Christmas special of _One Foot in the Grave_ ("One Foot in the Algarve"), playing a muckraking tabloid photographer. Before the end of the next year, his mother died, and a grief-stricken Cook returned to heavy drinking. He made his last television appearance on the show _Pebble Mill at One_ in November 1994.


Personal life and death

Cook was married three times. He was first married to Wendy Snowden, who he had met at university, in 1963 and they had two daughters, Lucy and Daisy. They were divorced in 1971 after eight years of marriage.[23] Cook then married his second wife, model and actress Judy Huxtable, in 1973, the marriage formally ending in 1989 after they had been separated for some years.[24] He married his third and final wife, Lin Chong, in 1989, with whom he remained married until his death in 1995. Cook became stepfather to Chong's daughter, Nina. [25] Chong died at the age of 71 in November 2016.[26]

Cook died from a gastrointestinal hemorrhage[27] on 9 January 1995, aged 57. His body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, and his ashes were buried in an unmarked plot behind St John-at-Hampstead, not far from his home in Perrins Walk.

Dudley Moore attended Cook's memorial service at St John-at-Hampstead on 1 May 1995.[28] He and Martin Lewis presented a two-night memorial for Cook at The Improv in Los Angeles, on 15 and 16 November 1995, to mark what would have been Cook's 58th birthday.[29]

Cook was an avid spectator of most sports and was a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur football club.[30]


Legacy

marking the site of the Establishment Club in Greek Street, Soho, London]]

Cook is widely acknowledged as a strong influence on the many British comedians who followed him from the amateur dramatic clubs of British universities to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and then to radio and television. On his death, some critics choose to see Cook's life as tragic, insofar as the brilliance of his youth had not been sustained in his later years. However, Cook himself always maintained he had no ambitions at all for sustained success. He assessed happiness by his friendships and his enjoyment of life. Eric Idle said Cook had not wasted his talent, but rather that the newspapers had tried to waste him.[31]

Several friends honoured him with a dedication in the closing credits of _Fierce Creatures_ (1997), a comedy film written by John Cleese about a zoo in peril of being closed. It starred Cleese alongside Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin. The dedication displays photos and the lifespan dates of Cook and of British naturalist and humourist Gerald Durrell.

In 1999, the minor planet 20468 Petercook, in the main asteroid belt, was named after Cook.[32]

Channel 4 broadcast _Not Only But Always_, a television film dramatising the relationship between Cook and Moore, with Rhys Ifans portraying Cook. At the 2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, a play, _Pete and Dud: Come Again_ written by Chris Bartlett and Nick Awde, examined the relationship from Moore's view. The play was transferred to London's West End at The Venue in 2006 and toured the UK the following year. During the West End run, Tom Goodman-Hill starred as Cook, with Kevin Bishop as Moore.

A green plaque to honour Cook was unveiled by the Westminster City Council and the Heritage Foundation at the site of the Establishment Club, at 18 Greek Street, on 15 February 2009 after an online campaign by satirist and event organiser Mark Biddiss, who also organised ‘The World's 1st Peter Cook is Dead Birthday Party / Long overdue Public Wake’ to promote the plaque, which featured a live reworking of Derek and Clive material, titled _Derek & Clive are Alive Again_.[33]

A historic blue plaque was unveiled by the Torbay Civic Society on 17 November 2014 at Cook's place of birth, "Shearbridge", Middle Warberry Road, Torquay, with his widow Lin and other members of the family in attendance. A further blue plaque was commissioned and erected at the home of Torquay United, Plainmoor, Torquay, in 2015.[34]
