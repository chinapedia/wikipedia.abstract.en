History

Roman

Hammam_zouakra.jpg The name of the town (THIGIBBA BURE) was derived from a prior Roman town on the same site.[4] During the Roman and Byzantine-era it was a civitas of Africa Proconsularis Province from 330 BC – 640 AD[5] The town has numerous ruins, inscription[6] Triumphal arch and an extensive necropolis excavated by the French.[7] The site includes many megalithic tombs[8] of pre-Punic construction and may indicate a Numidian royal city at one time.[9] The commanding position overlooking the surrounding plains would make such a location ideal for this.

The ruins of Thigibba Bure is located 4 km from Sidi Bou Zacouma and Mount Djebel Goraa at 36°28'32.4_N and 9°4'53.5_E. Among the Roman-era ruins are well preserved public toilets[10] and a triumphal arch.[11] in which it is written « SI QUI HIC URINAM FECERIT HABEBIT MARTEM IRATUM », meaning "If someone urinates here, he will have Mars irritated".
