The _METAL CONQUEROR TOUR_ was a concert tour by British heavy metal band Judas Priest in support of the album _Defenders of the Faith_. It ran from 20 January until 13 September 1984.

Following the tour, the band took a one-year hiatus from touring, apart from a brief performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert in Philadelphia.


Recordings

The 2015 release of _Defenders of the Faith_'s 30th anniversary edition features the concert from 5 May 1984 in Long Beach Arena, Long Beach, California in its entirety. Prior to this release, select tracks from the same concert were featured as bonus tracks on the 2001 remasters of _Sin After Sin_, _British Steel_, _Defenders of the Faith_, _Priest...Live!_ and _Ram It Down._


Production

The stage production featured a large drum riser prop in the shape of the Metallian that adorns the _Defenders of the Faith_ album cover. During the concert, the band members would enter the stage through the prop's mouth our under either of its raisable legs. Halford's staple live stunt of riding a motorcycle on stage had him emerge from under the one of the legs.


Europe warm-up leg

A special pre-_Defenders of the Faith_ mini tour took place in the United Kingdom and Germany, which went from 12 to 22 December 1983 with support act Quiet Riot. They would also perform at the _Rock Pop Festival_ at Westfalenhallen in Dortmund on 18 December with Iron Maiden, Scorpions, Ozzy Osbourne, Def Leppard and Quiet Riot.[1]

Tour dates

The band toured with Ted Nugent and Raven on the European leg and Great White and Kick Axe on the North American leg.[2]

On 18 June 1984, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, a riotous crowd prompted the venue to ban Priest.[3] "Madison Square Garden banned us for life", recalled Glenn Tipton. "The audience went berserk and ripped all the seats out. They cost more than a quarter of a million dollars to replace. Me and Ken _[KK Downing]_ went back there to see a tennis match which John McEnroe was playing in. We went incognito, wearing hoodies so no one would recognize us, but the ushers came up to us and said, 'Thanks for the new seats, guys.'"[4]
