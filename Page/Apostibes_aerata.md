_APOSTIBES AERATA_ is a moth of the family Scythrididae. It was described by Lord Walsingham in 1914. It is found in Mexico (Guerrero).[1]

The wingspan is about 12Â mm. The forewings are shining, pale brassy greenish, becoming more coppery towards the costa and at the apex. A white streak coming from the base below the costa terminates in the fold at about one-fourth, and there is a white patch lying a little beyond it and reaching the costa before the middle, a similar white patch, bent inward from the costa before the apex and reverting to the dorsum is found at the end of the fold. The hindwings are dark reddish fuscous.[2]
