The GRUTA DO CARVÃO (_Grotto of Coal_) is an ancient lava tube located on the outskirts of the municipality of Ponta Delgada (in the civil parish of Santa Clara) on the island of São Miguel in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores.


History

Ponta_Delgada_-_Gruta_do_Carvão_-_02.jpg Gaspar Frutuoso, the 16th century chronicler and historian wrote:

    _"Afar, a short way from the Fortress, going west, is a place called Ponta dos Algares, because there are two grottos with their opening, inside which there is a large underground path where rivers of lava seeming to have run in ancient times, not known nor seen."_[1]

Owing to its scientific, educational and touristic relevance, as well as its natural characteristics, the Gruta do Carvão was classified as a Regional natural Monument by Regional Decree 4/2005/A on 11 May 2005.[2]


Geography

Ponta_Delgada_-_Gruta_do_Carvão_-_03.jpg Ponta_Delgada_-_Gruta_do_Carvão_-_01.jpg The Gruta is situated in the parish of Santa Clara, in the northwest part of Ponta Delgada and is integrated into the _Monumento Natural Regional da Gruta do Carvão_ (_Regional Natural Monument of Gruta do Carvão_), to the northwest of water reservoirs of SMAS, along _Rua do Paim_.[3]

The largest lava tunnel on the island of São Miguel, the cave is located in the western edge of Ponta Delgada and extends for . It is divided into three sections: _Rua de Lisboa_ (or _Secadores de Tabaco_), _Rua do Paim_ and _Rua João do Rego_. Yet, older documents and field work suggest that the tube actually longer, and may reach a length of .[4] The section at _Rua do Paim_ is approximately long, with an internal cavity that is at its maximum extent high and wide.[5]

Along the cavern walls are speleological structures such as lateral benches, lava bridges, branching galleries, lava balls, stalactites, stalagmites, columns, spongy lavas, glaze and tree moulds.[6] Apart from several cracks, the walls and ceiling are multi-coloured (orange to yellowish) due to the basalt oxidization. There are also conical-shaped stalactites, secondary mineral deposits of silica and earthen deposits covering the walls and ceiling.[7] Many of the stalagmites are long with long sections of superimposed, soda-straw, conical ring-type tubes with pitted pockets.[8]
