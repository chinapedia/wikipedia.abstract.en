Although Monnet wishes she had returned to school to pursue her arts, she strongly believes that the most valuable lessons aren’t taught in school.[17] She is widely known for her sculpting, work in film and installation. Her journey with art began in hopes to reclaim her aboriginal identity in which she has suppressed throughout her life.[18] Monnet is recognized for her works such as _Ikwe, Mobilize, Roberta, Itw_e, and the list goes on.

Style

Monnet's work in film, painting and sculpture deals with complex ideas around Indigenous identity and bicultural living through the examination of cultural histories.[27] She is interested in themes of identity, representation, and modernity.[28] Monnet has made a signature for working with industrial materials, combining the vocabulary of popular and traditional visual culture with the tropes of modernist abstraction to create unique hybrid forms.[29] Caroline Monnet is an artist who strives to offer her best work as well as offers advice to other female directors. She encourages other female directors to never let go of their dreams and to never let go of the fact that they are female, get in the way of reaching their goals. She suggests to always surround yourself with people who respects you and your work and to work as hard as possible and the rest will take care of itself.[30]
