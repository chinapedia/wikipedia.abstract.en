_PROCERATIUM PETROSUM_ is an extinct species of formicid in the ant subfamily Proceratiinae known from a fossil found in eastern Asia.


History and classification

_P. petrosum_ is known from a single ant found in Russia.[1] The specimen was described from a compression fossil preserved in diatomite deposits of the Bol’shaya Svetlovodnaya site. The site is exposed on the bank of Barachek Creek upstream from the creeks confluence with the Bol’shaya Svetlovodnaya River[2] in the Pozharsky District, on the Pacific Coast of Russia. The fossil-bearing rocks preserve possibly Priabonian plants and animals which lived in and around a small lake near a volcano. The site has been attributed to either the Maksimovka or Salibez Formations and compared to the Bembridge Marls and Florissant Formation, both of which are Priabonian in age.[3]

At the time of description, the holotype male specimen, number PIN 3429/103 was preserved in the A. A. Borissiak Paleontological Institute collections, part of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The fossil was first described by the trio of paleomyrmecologists Gennady Dlussky, Alexandr Rasnitsyn and Ksenia Perfilieva. In the type description, Dlussky, Rasnitsyn and Perfilieva named the species _P. petrosum_, with the specific epithet derived the Latinized Greek _petros_ meaning "stone".[4]

As of the 2015 description of _P. petrosum_ six species of _Proceratium_ had been described from fossils. _P. denticulatum_, _P. dominicanum_, _P. gibberum_ and _P. poinari_ are younger than _P. petrosum_, being described from the Middle Miocene Dominican amber.[5] _P. eocenicum_ from Baltic amber is of similar age to _P. petrosum_, and the only other species with a described fossil male.[6] Of the six fossil species, _P. petrosum_ was the first to be described from a compression fossil.[7]


Description

Proceratium_eocenicum_paratype_GPIH-BE4507_head_profile.jpg'' paratype male]] The _P. petrosum_ male is preserved as a dorsal compression showing the upper surface of the head, thorax and abdomen, with fore-wings outspread to the side. The body length is estimated to have been , notably longer than the Baltic amber species _P. eocenicum_, which ranged between .[8] _P. petrosum_ has a head with a smoothly curved rear edge and no corners at the rear. The compound eyes and the ocelli are all large and distinct.[9]
