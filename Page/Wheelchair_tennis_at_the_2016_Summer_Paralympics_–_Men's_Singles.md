The men's singles wheelchair tennis tournament at the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro was held at the Olympic Tennis Centre in the Barra Olympic Park in Barra da Tijuca in the west zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from 9–16 September 2016.[1]

The largest wheelchair tennis event by entries at the 2016 Games, the competition ended in an all-British final, won by Gordon Reid over compatriate and doubles partner Alfie Hewett. The top two seeds, Stéphane Houdet of France, and Joachim Gerard of Belgium lost to their British opposition in the semifinals; Gerard rallied in the bronze medal play off to claim the final podium place. The win took Gordon Reid to the world rankings summit.
