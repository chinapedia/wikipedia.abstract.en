_LOVE IS IN THE AIR_ is the fourth studio album by Australian pop singer John Paul Young, released in 1978. The album was produced by Vanda & Young and released through Albert Productions. It peaked at number 32 on the ARIA Charts.The album spawned the singles: "Love Is in the Air", "The Day That My Heart Caught Fire", "Lost in Your Love" and "Fool in Love".[1][2]

In Europe, the album was titled _LOST IN YOUR LOVE_, so as not to be confused with the compilation album released earlier in 1978.[3]


Reception

_Village Voice_ critic Robert Christgau wrote: "If the title tune seems familiar it's because you tuned it out along with 'Kiss You All Over' a few months ago. The culprits are ex-Easybeats Harry Vanda and George 'No Relation' Young, the power-pop production heroes whose first LP with this singer actually did offer much of the bright thrust claimed for the style—not to mention the triviality that goes along with it. It didn't sell, though, and here V&Y prove their depth of aesthetic principle by mellowing and syncopating their boy into MOR AOR fodder, four leisurely tunes to the side."[4]

Whitney Z. Gomes from AllMusic gave the album 3 out of 5 saying, "Except for his mellow cool and a few Rod Stewart moves, Young does not bring much to the party. Which doesn't matter since Aussie powerhouses Vanda & Young are the toastmasters; the brains from The Easybeats obviously knew they were onto something with the breezy lead single, because both "The Day That My Heart Caught Fire" and "Lost in Your Love" seem like the same song with different titles. "Open Doors" sports Supertramp keys... but otherwise this platter settles for smooth '70s sailing, and nothing's wrong with that." [5]
