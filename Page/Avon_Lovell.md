AVON LOVELL is a Western Australian investigative journalist and writer who wrote books about the Perth Mint Swindle. His notorious book was the _Mickleberg Stitch_.[1]

He was born in 1945 and is a graduate in History from the University of Tasmania.[2]

His works were at times difficult to access due to his battles with authority.[3][4]

His work _Litany of lies_ culminates in the full array of stories collected from the aftermath of the Mickleberg Stitch era.[5][6] His long term concern about the careers of Don Hancock and Anthony Lewandowski also was developed further.

His work is also corroborated by other writers.[7]
