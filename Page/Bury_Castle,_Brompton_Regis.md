BURY CASTLE near Brompton Regis in the English county of Somerset was an Iron Age univallate hillfort which was reused with the creation of a motte after the Norman Conquest. It has been scheduled as an ancient monument.[1]


Iron Age fort

It is an oval enclosure just above the confluence of the River Haddeo and River Exe.[2] It is approximately long and wide.[3]


Medieval period

In the late 1130s, a civil war, known as the Anarchy, broke out in England between the supporters of King Stephen and the Empress Matilda. A motte and bailey castle was built on the Bury Castle side, probably by William de Say.[4] In 1198 Richard I confirmed that Brompton should be part of the inheritance of Matilda.[5]

The motte measures and was placed on the southern tip of the promontory, with the bailey beyond around across.[6][7]
