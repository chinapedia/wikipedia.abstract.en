In geometry, an _n_-sided ANTIPRISM is a polyhedron composed of two parallel copies of some particular _n_-sided polygon, connected by an alternating band of triangles. Antiprisms are a subclass of the prismatoids and are a (degenerate) type of snub polyhedron.

Antiprisms are similar to prisms except the bases are twisted relative to each other, and that the side faces are triangles, rather than quadrilaterals.

In the case of a regular _n_-sided base, one usually considers the case where its copy is twisted by an angle . Extra regularity is obtained when the line connecting the base centers is perpendicular to the base planes, making it a RIGHT ANTIPRISM. As faces, it has the two _n_-gonal bases and, connecting those bases, 2_n_ isosceles triangles.


Uniform antiprism

A UNIFORM ANTIPRISM has, apart from the base faces, 2_n_ equilateral triangles as faces. As a class, the uniform antiprisms form an infinite series of vertex-uniform polyhedra, as do the uniform prisms. For 2}} we have as degenerate case the regular tetrahedron as a _digonal antiprism_, and for 3}} the non-degenerate regular octahedron as a _triangular antiprism_.

The dual polyhedra of the antiprisms are the trapezohedra. Their existence was discussed and their name was coined by Johannes Kepler, though it is possible that they were previously known to Archimedes as they satisfy the same conditions on vertices as the Archimedean solids.

Cartesian coordinates

Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a right antiprism with _n_-gonal bases and isosceles triangles are

$$\left( \cos\frac{k\pi}{n}, \sin\frac{k\pi}{n}, (-1)^k h \right)$$

with _k_ ranging from 0 to 2_n_ − 1; if the triangles are equilateral,

$$2h^2=\cos\frac{\pi}{n}-\cos\frac{2\pi}{n}.$$


Volume and surface area

Let _a_ be the edge-length of a uniform antiprism. Then the volume is

$$V = \frac{n \sqrt{4\cos^2\frac{\pi}{2n}-1}\sin \frac{3\pi}{2n} }{12\sin^2\frac{\pi}{n}}  a^3$$

and the surface area is

$$A = \frac{n}{2} \left( \cot{\frac{\pi}{n}} + \sqrt{3}\right) a^2.$$


Related polyhedra

There are an infinite set of truncated antiprisms, including a lower-symmetry form of the truncated octahedron (truncated triangular antiprism). These can be alternated to create snub antiprisms, two of which are Johnson solids, and the _snub triangular antiprism_ is a lower symmetry form of the icosahedron.

Symmetry

The symmetry group of a right _n_-sided antiprism with regular base and isosceles side faces is D_(_n_d) of order 4_n_, except in the case of a tetrahedron, which has the larger symmetry group T_(d) of order 24, which has three versions of D_(2d) as subgroups, and the octahedron, which has the larger symmetry group O_(h) of order 48, which has four versions of D_(3d) as subgroups.

The symmetry group contains inversion if and only if _n_ is odd.

The rotation group is D_(_n_) of order 2_n_, except in the case of a tetrahedron, which has the larger rotation group T of order 12, which has three versions of D₂ as subgroups, and the octahedron, which has the larger rotation group O of order 24, which has four versions of D₃ as subgroups.

Antiprisms.pdf Uniform star antiprisms are named by their star polygon bases, {_p_/_q_}, and exist in prograde and retrograde (crossed) solutions. Crossed forms have intersecting vertex figures, and are denoted by inverted fractions, _p_/(_p_ - _q_) instead of _p_/_q_, e.g. 5/3 instead of 5/2.

In the retrograde forms but not in the prograde forms, the triangles joining the star bases intersect the axis of rotational symmetry.

Some retrograde star antiprisms with regular star polygon bases cannot be constructed with equal edge lengths, so are not uniform polyhedra. Star antiprism compounds also can be constructed where _p_ and _q_ have common factors; thus a 10/4 antiprism is the compound of two 5/2 star antiprisms.
