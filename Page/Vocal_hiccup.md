VOCAL HICCUP is a "hiccuping" singing technique which was notably used by Buddy Holly and Michael Jackson.


Buddy Holly

Buddy Holly used the "vocal hiccup" in many his songs. It is described as "a clipped ‘uh’ sound used to emphasize certain words", for example, "We-UH-ell, the little things you say and do, make me want to be with you-UH-ou..." in his record of the song _Rave On_ (1958).[1]

Edward Comentale asserts that Holly's hiccup technique comes from the southern tradition of "eefing". He describes it as follows: "he [Buddy Holly] cuts off the sound at the back of the throat, blocking the flow of sound so that it pops out again with greater intensity - hic-a! A sharp break or silence is immediately followed by a loud burp, ann extra 'supplemental' syllable."[2]

Scott "Buddy" Cameron, known for his impersonation of Buddy Holly, in particular in the 2005-2009 production of _Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story_ musical, among other "trademark" features of Buddy Holly, uses " lilting vocal hiccup".[3][4]


Michael Jackson

Michael Jackson started using the "vocal hiccup" in 1973, in the song "It's Too Late to Change the Time" on the _G.I.T.: Get It Together_ album. The next time he used this technique several years later, in his 1979 solo album _Off the Wall_. Jackson's hiccup technique is described as "somewhat like a gulping for air or gasping". [5]

Diana Ross claimed on _The Today Show_ that Michael Jackson took the vocal hiccup technique from her.[6]
