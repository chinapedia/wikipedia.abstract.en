_MAGIC: THE GATHERING_ (colloquially known as _MAGIC_ CARDS or just _MAGIC_) is both a collectible and digital collectible card game created by Richard Garfield.[1] Released in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast (now a subsidiary of Hasbro), _Magic_ was the first trading card game and has approximately twenty million players ,[2][3][4] and over twenty billion _Magic_ cards produced in the period from 2008 to 2016, during which time it grew in popularity.[5]

Each game of _Magic_ represents a battle between wizards known as _planeswalkers_ who cast spells, use artifacts, and summon creatures as depicted on individual cards in order to defeat their opponents, typically, but not always, by draining them of their 20 starting _life points_. Although the original concept of the game drew heavily from the motifs of traditional fantasy role-playing games such as _Dungeons & Dragons_, the gameplay bears little similarity to pencil-and-paper adventure games, while simultaneously having substantially more cards and more complex rules than many other card games.

_Magic_ can be played by two or more players, either in person with printed cards or on a computer, smartphone or tablet with virtual cards through the Internet-based software _Magic: The Gathering Online_ or other video games such as _Magic: The Gathering Arena_. It can be played in various rule formats, which fall into two categories: _constructed_ and _limited_. Limited formats involve players building a deck spontaneously out of a pool of random cards with a minimum deck size of 40 cards; in constructed formats, players create decks from cards they own, usually with a minimum of 60 cards per deck.

New cards are released on a regular basis through expansion sets. An organized tournament system (the DCI) played at the international level and a worldwide community of professional _Magic_ players have developed, as well as a substantial resale market for _Magic_ cards. Certain cards can be monetarily valuable due to their rarity in production and utility in gameplay, with prices ranging from a few cents to thousands of dollars.


History

Richard Garfield was a doctoral candidate in combinatorial mathematics at University of Pennsylvania when he first started to design the game. During his free time he worked with local volunteer playtesters to help refine the game. He had been brought on as an adjunct professor at Whitman College in 1991 when Peter Adkison (then CEO of Wizards of the Coast games company) first met with Garfield to discuss Garfield's new game _RoboRally_. Adkison saw the game as very promising, but declined to produce it as Wizards of the Coast lacked the resources. He did like Garfield's ideas and mentioned that he was looking for a portable game that could be played in the downtime that frequently occurs at gaming conventions. Garfield returned and presented the general outline of the concept of a trading card game, based on his earlier game _Five Magics_ from 1982.[6] Adkison immediately saw the potential of this idea and agreed to produce it.[7] _Magic: The Gathering_ underwent a general release on August 5, 1993.[8]

While the game was simply called _Magic_ through most of playtesting, when the game had to be officially named a lawyer informed them that the name _Magic_ was too generic to be trademarked. _Mana Clash_ was instead chosen to be the name used in the first solicitation of the game, however, everybody involved with the game continued to refer to it simply as _Magic_. After further legal consultation, it was decided to rename the game _Magic: The Gathering_, thus enabling the name to be trademarked.[9]

A patent was granted to Wizards of the Coast in 1997 for "a novel method of game play and game components that in one embodiment are in the form of trading cards" that includes claims covering games whose rules include many of _Magic_'s elements in combination, including concepts such as changing orientation of a game component to indicate use (referred to in the rules of _Magic_ and later of Garfield's games such as _Vampire: The Eternal Struggle_ as "tapping") and constructing a deck by selecting cards from a larger pool.[10] The patent has aroused criticism from some observers, who believe some of its claims to be invalid.[11] In 2003, the patent was an element of a larger legal dispute between Wizards of the Coast and Nintendo, regarding trade secrets related to Nintendo's _Pokémon Trading Card Game_. The legal action was settled out of court, and its terms were not disclosed.[12]

_Magic_ was an immediate success for Wizards of the Coast.[13] Early on they were even reluctant to advertise the game because they were unable to keep pace with existing demand.[14] Initially _Magic_ attracted many _Dungeons & Dragons_ players,[15] but the following included all types of other people as well.[16] The success of the game quickly led to the creation of similar games by other companies as well as Wizards of the Coast themselves. Companion Games produced the Galactic Empires CCG (the first science fiction trading card game), which allowed players to pay for and design their own promotional cards, while TSR created the _Spellfire_ game, which eventually included five editions in six languages, plus twelve expansion sets. Wizards of the Coast produced _Jyhad_ (now called _Vampire: The Eternal Struggle_), a game about modern-day vampires. Other similar games included trading card games based on _Star Trek_ and _Star Wars_.[17] _Magic_ is often cited as an example of a 1990s collecting fad, though the game's makers were able to overcome the bubble traditionally associated with collecting fads.[18]

The success of the initial edition prompted a reissue later in 1993, along with expansions to the game. _Arabian Nights_ was released as the first expansion in December 1993. New expansions and revisions of the base game ("Core Sets") have since been released on a regular basis, amounting to four releases a year. By the end of 1994, the game had printed over a billion cards.[19] Until the release of _Mirage_ in 1996, expansions were released on an irregular basis. Beginning in 2009 one revision of the core set and a set of three related expansions called a "block" were released every year. This system was revised in 2015, with the Core Set being eliminated and blocks now consisting of two sets, released biannually. While the essence of the game has always stayed the same, the rules of _Magic_ have undergone three major revisions with the release of the _Revised Edition_ in 1994, _Classic_ Edition in 1999, and _Magic 2010_ in July 2009.[20] With the release of the _Eighth Edition_ in 2003, _Magic_ also received a major visual redesign.

In 1996, Wizards of the Coast established the "Pro Tour",[21] a circuit of tournaments where players can compete for sizeable cash prizes over the course of a single weekend-long tournament. In 2009 the top prize at a single tournament was US$40,000.[22] Sanctioned through the DCI, the tournaments added an element of prestige to the game by virtue of the cash payouts and media coverage from within the community. For a brief period of time, ESPN2 televised the tournaments.[23]

By April 1997, cards had been sold.[24] In 1999, Wizards of The Coast was acquired by Hasbro for $325 million, making _Magic_ a Hasbro game.

While unofficial methods of online play existed previously,[25] _Magic Online_ (often shortened to "MTGO" or "Modo"), an official online version of the game, was released in 2002. A new, updated version of _Magic Online_ was released in April 2008.[26]

In January 2014, Hasbro announced a franchise film deal with 20th Century Fox for _Magic: The Gathering_, saying that they wanted "to launch a massive franchise on the scale of _Harry Potter_ and _The Lord of the Rings_." Simon Kinberg was to serve as a producer for the project.[27] In June 2014, Fox hired screenwriter Bryan Cogman to write the script for the film.[28] As of 2019, no film has entered production.

In February 2018, Wizards noted that between the years of 2008 and 2016 they had printed over 20 billion _Magic: the Gathering_ cards.[29]

In June 2019, it was announced that the Russo Brothers are producing an animated series for _Magic: The Gathering_ on Netflix.[30]


Reception

A 2004 article in _USA Today_ suggested that playing _Magic_ might help improve the social and mental skills of some of the players. The article interviewed players' parents who believe that the game, similar to sports, teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose. _Magic_ also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed that playing _Magic_ helped keep their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs. On the other hand, the article also briefly mentions that _Magic_ can be highly addictive, leading to parents worried about their children's _Magic_ obsession.[31] In addition, until 2007, some of the better players had opportunities to compete for a small number of scholarships.[32]

Jordan Weisman, an American game designer and entrepreneur, commented,

  "I love games that challenge and change our definition of adventure gaming, and _Magic: The Gathering_ is definitely one of a very short list of titles that has accomplished that elusive goal. By combining the collecting and trading elements of baseball cards with the fantasy play dynamics of role-playing games, _Magic_ created a whole new genre of product that changed our industry forever."[33]

In 2015, _The Guardian_ reported that an estimated 20 million people played _Magic_ around the world and that the game had a thriving tournament scene, a professional league and a weekly organized game program called Friday Night Magic.[34]

A July 2019 article in _Bloomberg_ reported that "_Magic_ is part of the [Hasbro’s] 'franchise brands,' a segment that accounted for $2.45 billion in net revenue for the company last year, bigger than its emerging, partner and gaming brand units combined. [Chris] Cocks said _Magic_ accounts for a 'meaningful portion' of that, with KeyBanc estimating the game’s contribution is already more than $500 million—including both the physical cards and the nascent digital version. Of the franchise brands, only _Magic_ and Monopoly logged revenue gains last year".[35] _Magic: The Gathering Arena_, in open beta testing since September 2018, is a free-to-play digital collectible card game with microtransaction purchases based on _Magic_.[36][37] Brett Andress, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, predicts _Magic: The Gathering Arena_ adding as much as 98 cents a share in incremental earnings to results by 2021 (which is at least a 20% boost).[38] Joe Deaux, for _Bloomberg_, wrote that "nearly 3 million active users will be playing Arena by the end of this year, KeyBanc estimates, and that could swell to nearly 11 million by 2021 according to its bull case scenario—especially if it expands from PCs to mobile. That’s just active users, and registered users could be higher by the millions. Already, according to Hasbro, a billion games have been played online".[39]

Gameplay

A game of _Magic_ involves two or more players who are engaged in a battle acting as powerful wizards called _planeswalkers_. Each player has their own deck, either one previously constructed or made from a limited pool of cards for the event. A player starts the game with twenty "life points" and loses the game when their life total is reduced to zero. A player can also lose if they must draw from an empty deck. In addition, some cards specify other ways to win or lose the game.[55] Garfield has stated that two major influences in his creation of _Magic: the Gathering_ were the games _Cosmic Encounter_,[56] which first used the concept that normal rules could sometimes be overridden, and _Dungeons & Dragons_. The "Golden Rule of _Magic_" states that "Whenever a card's text directly contradicts the rules, the card takes precedence."[57] The _Comprehensive Rules_, a detailed rulebook, exists to clarify conflicts.[58]

Players begin the game by shuffling their decks and then drawing seven cards.[59] Players draw one card at the beginning of each of their turns, except the first player on their first turn unless there are more than 2 players. Players alternate turns. The two basic kinds of cards are "spells" and "lands". Lands provide "mana", or magical energy, which is used as magical fuel when the player attempts to cast spells. Players may only play one land per turn. More powerful spells cost more mana, so as the game progresses more mana becomes available, and the quantity and relative power of the spells played tends to increase. Spells come in several varieties: "sorceries" and "instants" have a single, one-time effect before they go to the "graveyard" (discard pile); "enchantments" and "artifacts" are "permanents" that remain in play after being cast to provide a lasting magical effect; "creature" spells (also a type of permanent) summon creatures that can attack and damage an opponent. The set _Lorwyn_ introduced the new "planeswalker" card type, which represents powerful allies who fight with their own magic abilities.[60]

Deck construction

In most Constructed tournament formats, decks are required to be a minimum of sixty cards, with no upper limit.[61] Players may use no more than four copies of any named card, with the exception of "basic lands", which act as a standard resource in _Magic_, and some specific cards that state otherwise. For example, the card Relentless Rats states that a deck may contain any number of itself.[62] Certain formats such as Commander[63] may limit the number of iterations of a single card players may have in their decks.[64] These are colloquially known as singleton formats.

In most Constructed formats, there exists a list of individual cards which have been "restricted" (the card is limited to a single copy per deck) or "banned" (the card is no longer legal for tournament play).[65] These limitations are usually for balance of power reasons, but have been occasionally made because of gameplay mechanics.[66]

In "Limited" tournament formats, a small number of cards are opened for play from booster packs or tournament packs, and a minimum deck size of forty cards is enforced. The most popular limited format is Booster Draft, in which players open a booster pack, choose a card from it, and pass it to the player seated next to them. This continues until all the cards have been picked, and then a new pack is opened. Three packs are opened altogether, and the direction of passing alternates left-right-left.[67] Once the draft is done, players create 40-card decks out of the cards they picked and play games with the players they drafted with.

Deck building requires strategy as players must choose among thousands of cards which they want to play. This requires players to evaluate the power of their cards, as well as the possible synergies between them, and their possible interactions with the cards they expect to play against (this "metagame" can vary in different locations or time periods).[68] The choice of cards is usually narrowed by the player deciding which colors they want to include in the deck. This decision is a key part of creating a deck. In general, reducing the number of colors used increases the consistency of play and the probability of drawing the lands needed to cast one's spells, at the expense of restricting the range of tactics available to the player.[69]

Colors of _Magic_

Most spells come in one of five colors. The colors can be seen on the back of the cards, in a pentagonal design, called the "Color Wheel" or "Color Pie". Clockwise from the top, they are: white (W), blue (U), black (B), red (R), and green (G).[70] To play a spell of a given color, at least one mana of that color is required. This mana is normally generated by a basic land: plains for white, island for blue, swamp for black, mountain for red, and forest for green. The balances and distinctions among the five colors form one of the defining aspects of the game. Each color has strengths and weaknesses based on the "style" of magic it represents.[71]

-   WHITE is the color of order, equality, righteousness, healing, law, community, peace, and light. White's strengths include a roster of smaller creatures, as well as the ability to create creature tokens, both of which are strong collectively; protecting and enhancing those creatures with enchantments; increasing one's life points; preventing damage to creatures or players; imposing restrictions on players; disabling the capabilities of opposing creatures; and powerful spells that "equalize" the playing field by destroying all cards of a given type. White creatures are renowned for their defense-favoring abilities, many of which include "Protection" and "Vigilance". White magic opposes artificial fabrication, this being represented by many of its spells that can destroy artifacts and enchantments. White's weaknesses include the fact that many of its spells favor smaller creatures; its passive playing style in which it relies on an opponent's actions to maximize its own effects; and the nature of its most powerful spells that usually affect all players equally—including the casting player.[72]
-   BLUE is the color of intellect, reason, illusion, logic, knowledge, manipulation, and trickery, as well as the classical elements of air and water. Blue's strengths include allowing a player to draw additional cards; permanently taking control of an opponent's cards; returning cards from the battlefield to their owner's hand; forcing cards to go directly from a player's deck to their graveyard; and negating spells before they are successfully cast. Blue's creatures tend to be weaker than those of the other colors, but commonly have abilities which make them difficult to block, "Flying" being the most common evasive ability among Blue creatures. Blue's power of extra-sensory perception is represented by the ability "Scry", which allows the player to look at the top cards of his or her deck and choose whether he or she will draw those cards the subsequent turns. Since Blue magic revolves around advancement and technology, it has the highest number of cards having beneficial interactions with artifacts. Blue's weaknesses include its inability to destroy spells already placed on the field, having them returned to the hand instead; the fixation on negating and delaying enemy actions, while itself lacking an aggressive plan; and the way it prolongs the game and victory, thus allowing the opponent a possibility for a sudden comeback.[73]
-   BLACK is the color of power, ambition, death, illness, corruption, selfishness, amorality, and sacrifice. It is not necessarily evil, though many of its cards refer directly or indirectly to this concept. Black's strengths include the ability to destroy creatures instantly; forcing players to discard cards from their hand; decreasing a player's life while you usually gain that same amount lost; evasive abilities are common among Black creatures; and resurrecting creatures from a player's graveyard. Furthermore, because Black seeks to win at all costs, it has limited access to many abilities or effects that are normally available only to one of the other colors; but these abilities often require large sacrifices of life totals, creatures, cards in hand, cards in library, and other difficult-to-replace resources.[74] One of the most notable abilities among Black creatures is "Deathtouch", which always causes creatures damaged by those possessing this ability to be sent to the graveyard, regardless of the damage amount assigned. Black's main weaknesses include an almost complete inability to deal with enchantments and artifacts; the tendency to inflict itself with severe negative effects in order to defeat the opponent; the way in which it overly relies on cards inside the graveyards; and difficulties in removing other Black creatures.[75]
-   RED is the color of freedom, chaos, passion, creativity, impulse, fury, warfare, lightning, the classical element of fire, and the abiotic geological aspects of the classical element earth.

Red's strengths include the ability to directly damage creatures or players; destroying opposing lands and artifacts; and sacrificing permanent resources for temporary but high-profit power. Red has a wide array of creatures, but (with the exception of late-game powerhouses, such as Red's notable dragons) most tend to be defensively weak, rendering them easier to destroy. As a trade-off, some of these weaker creatures have the ability to temporarily raise their offense value, leaving their defense value unaffected; many other Red spells focus on this concept of glass cannon offense. Much like Blue, Red explores the element of trickery, this being represented by spells that are able to temporarily steal an opponent's creatures; divert or copy other spells; and those involving random chance. In terms of keyword abilities, Red tends to focus on quickness and speed, this being represented by the popular abilities "Haste" and "First Strike". Red's weaknesses include its inability to destroy enchantments; the self-destructive, single-use nature of many of its spells; the overall lack of defense value or toughness of its creatures; and the way in which it trades early-game speed and vulnerability for late-game staying power, in which it may not last that long.[76]

-   GREEN is the color of life, nature, evolution/adaptability, ecology, interdependence, instinct, and indulgence. Green's strengths are on the battlefield, usually winning by means of combat with creatures, of which it has a broad menagerie. These tend to be notably strong at a low mana cost and have abilities that make them more survivable, the two most common being "Regenerate" and "Hexproof". Many of Green's creatures also possess the ability "Trample", which allows the attacking creature to deal combat damage to an opponent even if blocked by a weaker creature. Recurring elements among Green spells include increasing a creature's offense and defense value, temporarily or permanently; forcing two or more creature to fight with each other head-on; the opposition against creatures with "Flying"; and the ability to create creature tokens. Green spells often focus on growth, this being represented by gaining life points; generating extra quantities of mana; and directly obtaining land cards, thus allowing the player to cast their more expensive spells quicker than usual. Since Green magic revolves around natural order, many of its spells can destroy opposing artifacts and enchantments; notably, Green has the fewest cards having beneficial interactions with artifacts. Green's weaknesses include its inability to prevent non-combat-related attacks, namely actions that affect the hand, library, or graveyard; its one-track method of destroying enemy creatures through combat only; and its trouble stopping attacking creatures that have bypassed Green's own powerful creatures, beyond them being very little protection left.[77]

The colors adjacent to each other on the pentagon are "allied" and often have similar, complementary abilities. For example, Blue has a relatively large number of flying creatures, as do White and Black, which are next to it. The two non-adjacent colors to a particular color are "enemy" colors, and are thematically opposed. For instance, Red tends to be very aggressive, while White and Blue are often more defensive in nature. The Research and Development (R&D) team at Wizards of the Coast aims to balance power and abilities among the five colors by using the "Color Pie" to differentiate the strengths and weaknesses of each.[78] This guideline lays out the capabilities, themes, and mechanics of each color and allows for every color to have its own distinct attributes and gameplay. The Color Pie is used to ensure new cards are thematically in the correct color and do not infringe on the territory of other colors.

-   MULTI-COLOR cards were introduced in the _Legends_ set and typically use a gold frame to distinguish them from mono-color cards. These cards require mana from two or more different colors to be played and count as belonging to each of the colors used to play them. Multi-color cards typically combine the philosophy and mechanics of all the colors used in the spell's cost, and tend to be proportionally more powerful compared to single-color or hybrid cards, as requiring multiple colors of mana makes them harder to cast. More recently, two-color "hybrid" cards were introduced in the _Ravnica_ set, and appeared extensively throughout the _Shadowmoor_ and _Eventide_ sets. Hybrid cards are distinguished by a gradient frame with those two colors, and can be paid with either of the card's colors; for instance, a card with two hybrid-red/white icons can be cast using two red mana, two white mana, or one of each. Several sets have made multi-colored cards a theme, including _Invasion_, _Shards of Alara_, both _Ravnica_ blocks and others. Core sets do not typically include multi-color cards in them, although the Core 2013 set was the first to do so.
-   COLORLESS cards belong to no color, and most often appear in the form of Lands, Artifacts, or cards related to the Eldrazi creature type. Unlike the five colors, Colorless cards do not have a specific personality or style of play. Sometimes, colorless cards will imitate the mechanics of a particular color, though in a less-efficient manner than a similar colored card. Often colorless cards are linked to one or more colors via their abilities, through story references, or through flavor text on the cards themselves. With the _Rise of the Eldrazi_ expansion, however, colorless cards that are neither artifacts nor lands have been introduced for the first time in larger quantities. These cards have been more recently featured in the _Battle for Zendikar_ set that was released in 2015.

Luck vs. skill

_Magic_, like many other games, combines chance and skill. One frequent complaint about the game involves the notion that there is too much luck involved, especially concerning possessing too many or too few lands.[79] Early in the game especially, too many or too few lands could ruin a player's chance at victory without the player having made a mistake. This in-game statistical variance can be minimized by proper deck construction, as an appropriate land count can reduce mana problems. In _Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012_, the land count is automatically adjusted to 40% of the total deck size.[80]

A "mulligan" rule was introduced into the game, first informally in casual play and then in the official game rules. The most current mulligan rule allows players to shuffle an unsatisfactory opening hand back into the deck at the start of the game, draw a new hand with one fewer card, and repeat until satisfied, after which any player who has fewer than seven cards may look at the top card of his or her deck and either return it or put it at the bottom of the deck.[81] In multiplayer, a player may take one mulligan without penalty, while subsequent mulligans will still cost one card (a rule known as "Partial Paris mulligan").[82] The original mulligan allowed a player a single redraw of seven new cards if that player's initial hand contained seven or zero lands. A variation of this rule called a "forced mulligan" is still used in some casual play circles and in multiplayer formats on _Magic Online_, and allows a single "free" redraw of seven new cards if a player's initial hand contains seven, six, one or zero lands.[83]

Confessing his love for games combining both luck and skill, _Magic_ creator Richard Garfield admitted its influence in his design of _Magic_. In addressing the complaint about luck influencing a game, Garfield states that new and casual players tend to appreciate luck as a leveling effect, since randomness can increase their chances of winning against a more skilled player. Meanwhile, a player with higher skills appreciates a game with less chance, as the higher degree of control increases their chances of winning. According to Garfield, _Magic_ has and would likely continue decreasing its degree of luck as the game matured.[84] The "Mulligan rule", as well as card design, past vs. present, are good examples of this trend. He feels that this is a universal trend for maturing games. Garfield explained using chess as an example, that unlike modern chess, in predecessors, players would use dice to determine which chess piece to move.[85]

Gambling

The original set of rules prescribed that all games were to be played for ante. Garfield was partly inspired by the game of marbles and wanted folks to play with the cards rather than collect them.[86] For Magic, each player removed a card at random from the deck they wished to play with and the two cards would be set aside as the ante. At the end of the match, the winner would take and keep both cards.[87] Early sets included a few cards with rules designed to interact with this gambling aspect, allowing replacements of cards up for ante, adding more cards to the ante, or even permanently trading cards in play.

The ante concept became controversial because many regions had restrictions on games of chance. The rule was later made optional because of these restrictions and because of players' reluctance to possibly lose a card that they owned.[88] The gambling rule is forbidden at sanctioned events and is now mostly a relic of the past, though it still sees occasional usage in friendly games as well as the prismatic format.[89] The last card to mention ante was printed in the 1995 expansion set _Homelands_.


Organized play

, Germany competed for an invitation to a professional tournament in Nagoya, Japan.]]

_Magic_ tournaments regularly occur in gaming stores and other venues. Larger tournaments with hundreds of competitors from around the globe sponsored by Wizards of the Coast are arranged many times every year, with substantial cash prizes for the top finishers.[90] A number of websites report on tournament news, give complete lists for the most currently popular decks, and feature articles on current issues of debate about the game. The DCI, which is owned and operated by Wizards of the Coast, is the organizing body for sanctioned _Magic_ events. The two major categories of tournament play are "Constructed" and "Limited".

Constructed

In "Constructed" tournaments, each player arrives with a pre-built deck, which must have a minimum of sixty cards and follow other deck construction rules. The deck may also have up to a fifteen card sideboard, which allows players to modify their deck. Normally the first player to win two games is the winner of the match.[91]

Different formats of Constructed _Magic_ exist, each allowing different cards. The DCI maintains a "Banned and Restricted List" for each format; players may not use banned cards at all, and restricted cards are limited to one copy per deck.[92] The DCI bans cards that it determines are damaging the health of a format; it seeks to use this remedy as infrequently as possible, and only a handful of cards have been banned in recent years.

-   STANDARD, formerly known as Type 2, contains anywhere from five to eight sets. The Standard card pool undergoes a "rotation" once a year, usually in October, when older sets rotate out of the format and the fall set is released. As of October 10, 2018, the Standard card pool consists of _Ixalan_, _Rivals of Ixalan_, _Dominaria_, _Core Set 2019_, Guilds of Ravnica, and Ravnica Allegiance, with one card banned.[93] For the history of Standard, see Timeline of Magic: the Gathering Standard (Type II).
-   MODERN is a non-rotating format where all previously standard legal cards from 8th Edition forward are legal. It was first played at the Magic Online 2011 Community Cup, a response to players' desire for a non-rotating format that is more accessible to newer players. Wizards of the Coast introduced Modern as a legal format on August 12, 2011, and saw its first paper magic play at Pro Tour Philadelphia 2011.[94] Certain cards that released in products that are not standard legal such as Planechase or Commander series cards, are not legal in Modern.
-   LEGACY is an Eternal format, meaning it allows every card ever printed except cards on the Legacy banned list. It is distinguished from Vintage in that certain cards are banned for power reasons.[95]
-   VINTAGE is an Eternal format, meaning it allows every card ever printed except the Vintage banned list. The only banned cards in Vintage are cards using the "ante" mechanic or have "dexterity issues" which the DCI considers inappropriate for competitive Magic. However there is a unique "Restricted List" where only a single copy of a card is allowed to be played instead of the traditional 4. Because of the expense in acquiring the scarce old cards to play competitive Vintage, some unsanctioned Vintage tournaments permit players to proxy a certain number of cards.[96] Proxy cards are forbidden in DCI-sanctioned tournaments, except as replacements for damaged cards when created by the event judge.[97][98]
-   PAUPER is a format that only allows cards with the common rarity to be played. Although the format is played mainly on Magic: The Gathering Online, it has seen a physical resurgence after Pauper was featured in several Grand Prix events.
-   COMMANDER (originally known as Elder Dragon Highlander or EDH) is a casual format, but can be played competitively. In this format each player constructs a 100 singleton deck that has a legendary creature that acts as a commander. The deck construction is limited to the colors that are represented by the chosen commander and there cannot be two or more cards with the same name with the exception of basic lands. The legendary creature chosen as commander is kept in a special "command zone" and may be cast at any time you can afford to cast the creature. If the commander card would enter any zone other than the battlefield from anywhere, its owner has the choice to return that card to the "command zone", where it can be cast again for an additional two generic mana to its regular cost. The banned list and unique rules are governed by an independent body (not by Wizards of the Coast), although Wizards of the Coast has tried to make variants of Commander like 1v1 Commander, which has its own banlist, and Brawl, which only allows the use of Standard-legal cards. Wizards of the Coast releases pre-built commander decks[99] on a yearly basis.
-   TWO HEADED GIANT is a multiplayer format played in two-player teams. One team shares a life total and their turn phases, but have separate mana, cards, decks, and battlefields, and graveyards. Each player can block any creatures that are attacking them, their teammate, or any planeswalker their team controls. Cards that read "each opponent" or "each player" target each opponent, not the team together.[100]
-   BLOCK CONSTRUCTED formats are defined by the cycle of three sets of cards in a given block. For example, the _Ravnica_ block format consists of _Ravnica: City of Guilds_, _Guildpact_, and _Dissension_. Only cards that were printed in one of the sets in the appropriate block can be used in these formats.[101]

Limited

In "Limited" tournaments, players construct decks using booster packs plus any additional basic lands of their choice. The decks in Limited tournaments must be a minimum of forty cards. All unused cards function as the sideboard, which, as in "Constructed" formats, can be freely exchanged between games of a match, as long as the deck continues to adhere to the forty card minimum. The rule that a player may use only four copies of any given card does not apply.[102]

-   SEALED DECK tournaments give each player six 15-card booster packs from which to build his or her deck.
-   BOOSTER DRAFT is usually played with eight players. The players are seated around a table and each player is given three booster packs. Each player opens a pack, selects a card from it, and passes the remaining cards to the next player. Each player then selects one of the remaining cards from the pack he or she just received, and passes the remaining cards again. This continues until all of the cards are depleted. Players pass left for the first and third packs, and right for the second. Players then build decks out of any of the cards that they selected during the drafting. Talking, signaling, and showing cards is forbidden during the drafting process, except for double faced cards from the _Innistrad_ and _Shadows over Innistrad_ blocks and "Magic Origins", which cannot be hidden as each side of the physical card has a spell printed on it.

Other formats

Players often create their own formats based on any number of criteria. Sometimes these can be based on limiting the financial value of a deck, mixing and matching different blocks or sets, or taking an existing format and modifying the DCI Banned List. Commander (formerly Elder Dragon Highlander) was one such format, before becoming officially supported by Wizards of the Coast. One of the most popular player created formats for Limited is Cube Drafting. Similar in structure to Draft, players will instead use a collection of pre-selected cards instead of random boosters to draft from. Since 2014 player created formats are allowed as Friday Night Magic events,[103] so long as they follow basic Magic Tournament Rules (no fake cards, no gambling etc.)

Tournament structure

The DCI maintains a set of rules for being able to sanction tournaments, as well as runs its own circuit. Local shops often offer "Friday Night Magic" tournaments as a stepping-stone to more competitive play.[104] The DCI runs the Pro Tour as a series of major tournaments to attract interest. The right to compete in a Pro Tour has to be earned by either winning a Pro Tour Qualifier Tournament or being successful in a previous tournament on a similar level. A Pro Tour is usually structured into two days of individual competition played in the Swiss format. On the final day, the top eight players compete with each other in an elimination format to select the winner.[105]

At the end of the competition in a Pro Tour, players are awarded Pro Points depending on their finishing place. If the player finishes high enough, they will also be awarded prize money.[106] Frequent winners of these events have made names for themselves in the _Magic_ community, such as Gabriel Nassif, Kai Budde and Jon Finkel. As a promotional tool, the DCI launched the Hall of Fame in 2005 to honor selected players.[107]

At the end of the year the _Magic_ World Championship is held. The World Championship functions like a Pro Tour, except that competitors have to present their skill in three different formats (usually Standard, booster draft and a second constructed format) rather than one. Another difference is that invitation to the World Championship can be gained not through Pro Tour Qualifiers, but via the national championship of a country. Most countries send their top four players of the tournament as representatives, though nations with minor _Magic_ playing communities may send just one player. The World Championship also has a team-based competition, where the national teams compete with each other.[108]

At the beginning of the World Championship, new members are inducted into the Hall of Fame. The tournament also concludes the current season of tournament play and at the end of the event, the player who earned the most Pro Points during the year is awarded the title "Pro Player of the Year". The player who earned the most Pro Points and did not compete in any previous season is awarded the title "Rookie of the Year".[109]

Invitation to a Pro Tour, Pro Points and prize money can also be earned in lesser tournaments called Grand Prix that are open to the general public and are held more frequently throughout the year.[110] Grand Prix events are usually the largest _Magic_ tournaments, sometimes drawing more than 2,000 players. The largest _Magic_ tournament ever held was Grand Prix: Las Vegas in June 2013 with a total of 4,500 players.[111]


Product and marketing

_Magic: The Gathering_ cards are produced in much the same way as normal playing cards. Each _Magic_ card, approximately 63 × 88 mm in size (2.5 by 3.5 inches), has a face which displays the card's name and rules text as well as an illustration appropriate to the card's concept. 18,970 unique cards have been produced for the game ,[112] many of them with variant editions, artwork, or layouts, and 600–1000 new ones are added each year. The first _Magic_ cards were printed exclusively in English, but current sets are also printed in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.[113]

The overwhelming majority of _Magic_ cards are issued and marketed in the form of sets. For the majority of its history there were two types: the Core Set and the themed expansion sets. Under Wizards of the Coast's current production and marketing scheme, a new set is released quarterly. Various products are released with each set to appeal to different segments of the _Magic_ playing community:

-   The majority of cards are sold in booster packs, which contain fifteen cards normally divided into four rarities, which can be differentiated by the color of the expansion symbol.[114] A fifteen-card Booster Pack will typically contain one rare (gold), three uncommons (silver), ten commons (black), and one basic land (colored black, as commons). Sets prior to _Shards of Alara_ contained eleven commons instead of a basic land.

_Shards of Alara_ also debuted mythic rares (red-orange), which replace one in eight rare cards on average. There are also premium versions of every card with holographic foil, randomly inserted into some boosters in place of a common, which replace about one in seventy cards.

-   Each set since Kaladesh features two Planeswalker decks, which are meant to help new players learn the game. They contain a 60-card pre-constructed deck with an exclusive Planeswalker, as well as several exclusive cards, two booster packs from the set they accompany, as well as a rule guide and a card board box with an image of the included Planeswalker.
-   Each set from Shards of Alara to Eldritch Moon featured five Intro Packs, which fulfilled the same function as planeswalker decks. They contained a 60-card pre-constructed deck, as well as two booster packs from the set they accompany and a rule guide.
-   Each set from _Mirrodin Besieged_ to _Gatecrash_ featured two Event Decks, which were pre-constructed decks designed as an introduction to tournament play. Beginning with '' Dragon's Maze'', each set featured only one Event Deck. However, event decks were discontinued after the set "Battle for Zendikar".
-   Previously, cards were also sold in Tournament Packs typically containing three rares, ten uncommons, thirty-two commons, and thirty basic lands.[115] Tournament Packs were discontinued after _Shards of Alara_.

As of 2018, the number of consecutive sets set on the same world varies. For example, although _Dominaria_ takes place in one set, the _Guilds of Ravnica_ block will take place over three sets. In addition, small sets have been removed due to developmental problems and all sets are now large. Prior to this change, sets were put into two-set blocks, starting with a large set and ending with a smaller one three months later.[116] Prior to 2016, expansion sets were released in a three-set block (again, beginning with a larger set followed by two smaller sets). These sets consist almost exclusively of newly designed cards. Contrasting with the wide-ranging Core Set, each expansion is focused around a subset of mechanics and ties into a set storyline. Expansions also dedicate several cards to a handful of particular, often newly introduced, game mechanics.

The Core Sets began to be released annually (previously biennially) in July 2009 coinciding with the name change from _10th Edition_ to _Magic 2010_. This shift also introduced new, never before printed cards into the core set, something that previously had never been done.[117] However, core sets were discontinued following the release of _Magic Origins_, on July 17, 2015, at the same time that two-set blocks were introduced.[118] Wizards of Coast announced on June 12, 2017 that they plan on revamping and reintroducing a revamped core set,[119] and Core Set 2019 was released on July 13, 2018.

In addition to the quarterly set releases, _Magic_ cards are released in other products as well, such as the _Planechase_ and _Archenemy_ spin-off games. These combine reprinted _Magic_ cards with new, oversized cards with new functionality. _Magic_ cards are also printed specifically for collectors, such as the _From the Vault_ and _Premium Deck Series_ sets, which contain exclusively premium foil cards.

In 2003, starting with the _Eighth Edition_ Core Set, the game went through its biggest visual change since its creation—a new card frame layout was developed to allow more rules text and larger art on the cards, while reducing the thick, colored border to a minimum.[120] The new frame design aimed to improve contrast and readability using black type instead of the previous white, a new font, and partitioned areas for the name, card type, and power and toughness. The card frame was changed once again in Core Set 2015, which maintained the same templating, but made the card sleeker and added a holo-foil stamp to every rare and mythic card to curtail counterfeiting.

For the first few years of its production, _Magic: The Gathering_ featured a small number of cards with names or artwork with demonic or occultist themes, in 1995 the company elected to remove such references from the game. In 2002, believing that the depiction of demons was becoming less controversial and that the game had established itself sufficiently, Wizards of the Coast reversed this policy and resumed printing cards with "demon" in their names.[121]

Spin-offs

_Magic: The Gathering_ video games, comics, and books have been produced under licensing or directly by Wizards of the Coast.

In September 2011, Hasbro and IDW Publishing accorded to make a four-issue mini-series about _Magic: The Gathering_[122] with a new story but heavily based on MTG elements and with a new Planeswalker called _Dack Fayden_, which story is mainly developed in the planes of Ravnica and Innistrad. The ongoing series started in February 2012.[123]

In 2015 Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro published _Magic: The Gathering – Arena of the Planeswalkers_. Arena of the Planeswalkers is a tactical boardgame where the players maneuver miniatures over a customizable board game, and the ruleset and terrain is based on Heroscape, but with an addition of spell cards and summoning. The original master set includes miniatures that represent the five Planeswalkers Gideon, Jace, Liliana, Chandra, and Nissa as well as select creatures from the Magic: The Gathering universe.[124] They later released an expansion _Battle for Zendikar_ featuring multi-color Planeswalkers Kiora and Ob Nixilis and a colorless Eldrazi Ruiner, and a second master set Shadows Over Innistrad which has 4 new Planeswalkers and also includes the addition of cryptoliths.

Video games

While comics and books have mostly been supplements to develop a background story for the game, several video games have been produced which lean in varying degree on the original game. For the first computer games Wizards of the Coast had sold licenses to Acclaim and MicroProse roughly at the same time. While MicroProse's _Magic: The Gathering_ received favorable reviews, Acclaim's _Magic: The Gathering: BattleMage_ was mostly dismissed with negative reaction.[125]

With _Magic: The Gathering Online_ or MTGO for short, Wizards developed and released a computer version of the game themselves that allows players to compete online against other players using the original _Magic_ cards and rules. Players purchase digital cards, and are able to play online against each other using their digital collections. _Magic: The Gathering Online_ is the closest to paper magic of the digital alternatives.

A stripped down version of MTGO is _Magic: The Gathering – Duels of the Planeswalkers_ which was developed by Stainless Games and released for the Xbox 360 in June 2009. The game was ported to Windows in June of the next year. Six months after the PC release of _Duels of the Planeswalkers_, the game was ported to the PlayStation 3 platform. The game was the most-played Xbox Live title for two weeks after its release.[126] Stainless continued to release yearly updates to this, culminating in _Magic Duels_, a free-to-play title released in 2015.

Hiberium and D3 Publisher licensed _Magic: the Gathering_ for its mobile game, _Magic: The Gathering - Puzzle Quest_, combining deck building with match-3-style casual gaming. This was released in December 2015 and continues to be updated with new card sets from the physical game.

Cryptic Studios and Perfect World Entertainment have announced plans to create a _Magic: The Gathering_ massively multiplayer online role-playing game, to be released for personal computers and consoles.[127]

On November 3, 2017, _Magic: The Gathering Arena_, the successor to Duels of the Planeswalkers, entered its first closed stress test. On December 2017, the game entered closed beta, before entering open beta on September 27, 2018. _Arena_ was used for and invitational event held on March 28–31 at PAX East 2019. [128][129]

Film

In January 2014, 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to produce a _Magic: The Gathering_ film with Simon Kinberg as producer and TSG Entertainment (its co-financing partner), and Allspark Pictures as co-financers, after Universal Pictures allegedly dropped the film from their schedule (Both Universal and Hasbro had been developing the original _Magic: The Gathering_ film since 2009).[130]

In April 2016, _Enter the Battlefield_, a documentary about life on the Magic Pro Tour was released. The film was written by Greg Collins, Nathan Holt, and Shawn Kornhauser.[131]

Television

In June 2019, Variety reported that Joe and Anthony Russo, Wizards of the Coast, and Hasbro’s Allspark Animation have teamed with Netflix for an flash animated _Magic: The Gathering_ television series.[132] In July 2019 at the San Diego Comic Con, the Russos revealed the logo of the animated series and did spoke about doing an live action series.[133]

Parodies

In 1998, PGI Limited created _Havic: The Bothering_, which was a parody of _Magic: The Gathering_. Wizards of the Coast, which owned the rights to _Magic: The Gathering_, took active steps to hinder the distribution of the game and successfully shut out PGI Limited from attending GenCon in July 1998.[134] In an attempt to avoid breaching copyright and Richard Garfield's patent, each starter deck of _Havic_ had printed on the back side, "This is a Parody", and on the bottom of the rule card was printed, "_Do not have each player_: construct their own library of predetermined number of game components by examining and selecting [the] game components from [a] reservoir of game components or you may infringe on U.S. Patent No. 5,662,332 to Garfield."[135]

Three official parody expansions of _Magic_ exist: _Unglued_, _Unhinged_, and _Unstable_. Most of the cards in these sets feature silver borders and humorous themes. The silver-bordered cards are not legal for play in DCI-sanctioned tournaments.


Secondary market

version of the Black Lotus card (here, signed by the artist) is usually considered to be the most valuable non-promotional _Magic_ card ever printed, aside from misprinted cards.[136]]]

There is an active secondary market in individual cards among players and game shops. Many physical and online stores sell single cards or "playsets" of four of a card. Common cards rarely sell for more than a few cents and are usually sold in bulk. Uncommon cards and weak rare cards typically sell from 10¢ up to $1. The more expensive cards in standard tournament play are typically priced between $1 to $25, although many commonly played cards in the Modern and Legacy formats sell for $50 to $200. Foil versions of rare and mythic rare cards are typically priced at about twice as much as the regular versions. Some of the more sought-after rare and mythic rare cards can have foil versions that cost up to three or four times more than the non-foil versions.[137]

A few of the oldest cards, due to smaller printings and limited distribution, are highly valued and rare. This is partly due to the "Reserved List", a list of cards from the sets _Alpha_ to _Urza's Destiny_ (1994–1999) that Wizards has promised never to reprint.[138] The most expensive card that was in regular print (as opposed to being a promotional or special printing) is _Black Lotus_. In 2013, a "Pristine 9.5 grade" Beckett Grading Services graded Alpha Black Lotus was bought by an anonymous buyer, for a record $166,100.[139]

The secondary market started with comic book stores, and hobby shops displaying and selling cards, with the cards' values determined somewhat arbitrarily by the employees of the store. With the expansion of the internet, prices of cards were determined by the number of tournament deck lists a given card would appear in. If a card was played in a tournament more frequently, the cost of the card would be higher (in addition to the market availability of the card).[140] When eBay, Amazon, and other large online markets started to gain popularity, the _Magic_ secondary market evolved substantially. Buying and selling _Magic_ cards online became a source of income for people who learned how to manipulate the market.[141] Today, the secondary market is so large and complex, it has become an area of study for consumer research,[142] and some people make a career out of market manipulation, creating mathematical models to analyze the growth of cards' worth, and predict the market value of both individual cards, and entire sets of cards.[143][144] This is called _Magic: The Gathering_ finance.

As of late 2013, Wizards of the Coast has expressed concern over the increasing number of counterfeit cards in the secondary market.[145] Wizards of the Coast has since made an effort to counteract the rise of counterfeits by introducing a new holofoil stamp on all rare and mythic rare cards as of Magic 2015.[146]


Artwork

Each card has an illustration to represent the flavor of the card, often reflecting the setting of the expansion for which it was designed. Much of _Magic_'s early artwork was commissioned with little specific direction or concern for visual cohesion.[147] One infamous example was the printing of the creature Whippoorwill without the "flying" ability even though its art showed a bird in flight.[148] The art direction team later decided to impose a few constraints so that the artistic vision more closely aligned with the design and development of the cards. Each block of cards now has its own style guide with sketches and descriptions of the various races and places featured in the setting.[149]

A few early sets experimented with alternate art for cards. However, Wizards came to believe that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at a glance.[150] Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards.[151] When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast usually prints them with new art to make the older cards more collectible,[152] though they sometimes reuse well-received artwork if it makes sense thematically.

As _Magic_ has expanded across the globe, its artwork has had to change for its international audience. Artwork has been edited or given alternate art to comply with the governmental standards. For example, the portrayal of skeletons and most undead in artwork was prohibited by the Chinese government until 2008.[153][154]


Storyline

The way _Magic_ storylines are conceived and deployed has changed considerably over the years. The main premise of _Magic_ is that countless possible worlds (planes) exist in the Multiverse, and only unique and rare beings called Planeswalkers are capable of traversing the Multiverse. This allows the game to frequently change worlds so as to renew its mechanical inspiration, while maintaining planeswalkers as recurrent, common elements across worlds. An intricate storyline underlies the cards released in each expansion and is shown in the art and flavor text of the cards, as well as in novels and anthologies published by Wizards of the Coast (and formerly by Harper Prism). Important storyline characters, objects and locations often appear as cards in _Magic_ sets, usually as "Legendary" creatures, artifacts, and lands, or as "Planeswalker" cards.

The original _Magic: The Gathering Limited Edition_ has no overarching storyline, and the cards only have unconnected bits of lore and trivia to give the cards some individual depth. In the early expansion sets until _Visions_ there is usually no real story arc either. Instead, some of these sets are inspired from mythologies of various cultures. This is most apparent in Arabian Nights, that takes some of the One Thousand and One Nights characters and makes them into _Magic_ cards. Norse mythological influences can be seen worked into Ice Age and African influences into Mirage. However, not all of the early sets can be linked as directly to earth mythology.

Antiquities touches on an independent storyline about two warring brothers, Urza and Mishra. Homelands is the exception in that period. For this set, a back story was first conceived and the cards in the set were designed afterwards to fit the storyline.

Beginning with the _Weatherlight_ expansion there was a shift in the way _Magic_ storylines were used. For the blocks _Weatherlight_ through _Apocalypse_, the story was laid out in a character driven story, following the events of the Weatherlight ship and its crew. With help of the planeswalking capabilities of the Weatherlight, the protagonists travel through the multiverse to fight Yawgmoth and his army of Phyrexians.

_Odyssey_ through _Scourge_ are an unconnected storyline set 100 years later on Dominaria where multiple factions battle for control of the Mirari, a powerful magical artifact left by Karn.

After _Scourge_, _Magic_ storylines have mostly panned away from Dominaria. New planes were created to set the scene for new storylines. In contrast to the previous character driven stories, these releases focused on thematic worlds. This was the model from Mirrodin through Alara, a world split into five magically and culturally distinct "shards" but later reunited. During this block of time, _Time Spiral_ block was released, in which several Dominarian planeswalkers attempted to stop the time rifts that threatened to destroy Dominaria. This block contains the Multiverse-wide event known as the Mending, which powered down the current, godlike planeswalkers to mere mortals that happened to be able to travel to other planes. The event also set up the introduction of the Planeswalker type in Lorwyn block.

After Alara, _Magic_ visited Zendikar, a world used as a prison to entrap a race of interplanar parasitic monsters called the Eldrazi, which were inspired by H. P. Lovecraft's Old Ones.[155] Beginning with _Zendikar_ the world-centric storytelling was complemented by an overlying story layer. Planeswalker cards had been introduced in _Lorwyn_ and these Planeswalker characters were used to give the overarching storyline a sense of continuity, despite the constant change of setting. The block following Zendikar, _Scars of Mirrodin_, revisited the plane of Mirrodin, where the Mirran natives battled against an invading Phyrexian corruption unwittilingly left by Karn (again interconnecting various storylines).[156] To further integrate the storyline into the gameplay, certain events for the second set, _Mirrodin Besieged_, encouraged players to affiliate themselves with either the Mirran or Phyrexian faction. Much of the recent focus has been on both integrating the play experience with the story line and on making mechanics and individual cards which represent pivotal points in the story.

On _Innistrad_, a plane inspired heavily by gothic horror, its guardian angel has gone missing. Darkness has started to consume the plane, and the players must discover that the Helvault, a magical prison, has been holding the archangel Avacyn as well as demons. Thalia, a cathar of the Church of Avacyn, broke open the Helvault and released Avacyn as well as all of the demons. In the _Return to Ravnica_ block, players were encouraged to affiliate themselves with a guild and take control of the city of Ravnica by completing the maze discovered by Niv-Mizzet.

_Theros_ was a plane inspired by Greek mythology, containing many references to Greek mythological figures such as Prometheus and the pantheon of gods.

_Tarkir_ would have been a plane where dragons had long since died, controlled by five clans ruled by khans. Through time travel, the result of the struggle between the ancient clans and the dragons was reversed and the dragons now reign over each of the five clans, which are both similar and different to their alternate-timeline predecessors.

_Battle for Zendikar_ was a return to the plane of Zendikar, which had been ravaged by the Eldrazi horrors. This marks a change in _Magic_{{'}}s storytelling, where each block's story is shown from the perspective of a group of planeswalkers called the Gatewatch.

_Shadows Over Innistrad_ was a return to Innistrad, where Avacyn has been corrupted. The next set, _Eldritch Moon_, focuses on the fact that Emrakul, the most powerful Eldrazi titan that had been missing from the _Battle for Zendikar_ storyline, is now on Innistrad. Together, the Gatewatch must find a way to save the plane from Emrakul's influence. This story also focuses on cosmic horror instead of the traditional gothic horror of old Innistrad.

_Kaladesh_ had the Gatewatch go to Chandra Nalaar's home world, the titular plane of Kaladesh, where she finds her mother (presumed dead) and almost kills Tezzeret. Tezzeret later kidnaps Rashmi, winner of the famous Inventor's Fair, and begins a dastardly plot to control the ruling Consulate. With the Consulate imprisoning inventors and confiscating their devices following the Fair, tensions between the populace and the government reach a boiling point, as depicted in _Aether Revolt_. The block focuses on a Steampunk aesthetic, with the steam replaced by aether, a powerful material that works in nearly every part of life.

_Amonkhet_ had the Gatewatch set out to destroy the evil dragon planeswalker Nicol Bolas after learning of his dominion over the titular desert plane Amonkhet. In the desert, they find a city (Naktamun) teeming with food, water, and life, ruled by five gods, with Nicol Bolas seemingly absent altogether. The people of Naktamun train their entire lives to die in ritual combat, hoping to experience pure bliss in the afterlife when the God-Pharaoh (Bolas) returns to Amonkhet. In _Hour of Devastation_, Bolas returns as prophesied, only to raze Naktamun and reveal the true purpose of the training and combat: to create an army of physically-perfect and combat-adept mummies that serve as an unquestionably loyal army. Although the Gatewatch attempt to defeat Bolas, they are utterly defeated and are forced to flee from Amonkhet. The block's setting is based on ancient Egypt, with themes of social hierarchy and the contrast between life and death.

_Ixalan_ centered around the quest for the Golden City of Orazca and the artifact known as the Immortal Sun that lies within it. The tribes vying for the Immortal Sun include; the Sun Empire, an army of dinosaur-riding warriors; the River Heralds, a group of merfolk shamans; the Legion of Dusk, a coalition of vampire conquistadors; and the Brazen Coalition, a fleet of seafaring pirates. The story also follows Jace Beleren, who is stranded on Ixalan without any of his memories after the events of _Hour of Devastation_, and Vraska, a gorgon agent of Nicol Bolas posing as a pirate on the high seas. In _Rivals of Ixalan_, the quest for the Immortal Sun reaches its climax as all four tribes attempt to seize the Golden City and as Jace and Vraska attempt to defeat the devious sphinx Azor, the founder of the Azorius guild on Ravnica and the creator of the Immortal Sun.

_Dominaria_ was a return to the plane of the same name, which has not been seen in over a decade. The story starts right after the events of _Hour of Devastation,_ and involves Liliana, Chandra, and Gideon on their mission to kill the Demonlord Belzenlok, the final demon that Liliana made a pact with to secure her youth and power. The story arc culminates on Ravnica with _Guilds of Ravnica_, _Ravnica Allegiance_, with the guilds in disorder and chaos and Bolas manipulating them in preparation for an invasion and finale in _War of the Spark_.


Academic research

There are several examples of academic, peer-reviewed research concerning different aspects of _Magic: The Gathering_. One study examined how players use their imaginations when playing. This research studied hobby players and showed how players sought to create and participate in an epic fantasy narrative.[157] Another example used online auctions for _Magic_ cards to test revenue outcomes for various auction types.[158] A third example uses probability to examine _Magic_ card-collecting strategies.[159] Using a specific set of cards in a specialized manner has shown _Magic: The Gathering_ to be Turing complete.[160]
