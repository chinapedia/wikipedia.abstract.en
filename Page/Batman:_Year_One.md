"YEAR ONE", later referred to as "BATMAN: YEAR ONE", is an American comic book story arc published by DC Comics which recounts the superhero Batman's first year as a crime-fighter. It was written by Frank Miller, illustrated by David Mazzucchelli, colored by Richmond Lewis, and lettered by Todd Klein. _Batman: Year One_ originally appeared in issues #404–407 of the comic book title _Batman_ in 1987. As well as recounting Batman's early crime-fighting career, the story simultaneously examines the life of recently transferred officer James Gordon – eventually building towards their partnership.

There have been several reprints of the story: a hardcover, multiple trade paperback editions (one in standard comics paper with simpler coloring and one deluxe version with rich detailing in the colors — both colored by Richmond Lewis) and it has been included in _The Complete Frank Miller Batman_ hardcover. The story arc was adapted into an animated feature in 2011.


Publication history

Background

Batman (Bruce Wayne) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics who debuted in "The Case of the Chemical Syndicate", a story published in _Detective Comics_ #27 (May 1939). He was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger to capitalize on the success of DC's other superhero Superman and was inspired by characters from pulp fiction stories, such as the Shadow.[1][2] Batman's origin story was introduced in a two-page, 12-panel story by Kane and Finger from _Detective Comics_ #33 (Nov. 1939). In the story, a young Bruce witnesses the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha at the hands of a mugger. Bruce vows to avenge his parents' deaths by fighting crime; he takes the persona of Batman after a bat flies through his window one night. For the story, Finger lifted elements from tales published in _Popular Detective_ and _The Phantom_, while Kane traced artwork of Tarzan and from _Junior G-Men_.[3]

In the years afterward, much of DC's continuity became convoluted and contradictory. Examples of this were present in Batman's origin: in a 1948 story, Finger gave the mugger a name (Joe Chill), and in 1956 wrote that he killed Bruce's parents on behalf of the mob. Finger also went on to suggest that the Batman persona was inspired by a bat costume Thomas wore to a masquerade ball. Other stories depicted Bruce traveling across the world to learn the skills he would need as Batman.[4] In an effort to resolve continuity errors like these in the DC Universe, Marv Wolfman and George Pérez produced the 12-issue limited series _Crisis on Infinite Earths_.[5] Wolfman's plans for the DC Universe after _Crisis on Infinite Earths_ included relaunching every DC comic with a new first issue.[6]

During the production of _Crisis on Infinite Earths_, Frank Miller became the writer of Marvel Comics' _Daredevil_.[7] Miller had originally been the series' penciller,[8] but editor Dennis O'Neil soon made him the series' writer.[9] Sales rose dramatically after Miller began to write. For one critically acclaimed _Daredevil_ story, Miller collaborated with artist David Mazzucchelli. Miller went to work for DC as well, and produced the influential four-issue limited series _The Dark Knight Returns_ (1986). O'Neil also made the move to DC.[10]

Development

The contract Miller signed to produce _The Dark Knight Returns_ also required him to write a revamped Batman origin story. While Miller handled the writing and artwork of _The Dark Knight Returns_, he simply wrote "Year One", while Mazzucchelli joined to pencil.[11] In the past, Miller had been overwhelmed by having to handle both writing and illustration duties.[12] Todd Klein was the story's letterer, while Mazzucchelli's wife Richmond Lewis handled coloring. O'Neil edited the issues.[13] According to O'Neil, the contract Miller and Mazzucchelli signed to produce "Year One" in the ongoing _Batman_ series guaranteed publication within 6 months.[14]

autographing a copy of the collected story in 2012]] "Year One" was originally conceived as a graphic novel. O'Neil, who had been asked to edit several issues of _Batman_, was friends with Miller and was able to learn of the story. Reflecting on poor sales of _Batman_, O'Neil caught Miller one day while on a walk in Los Angeles and convinced him and Mazzucchelli to serialize the story in the ongoing series.[15] Miller was initially reluctant; he felt this would be hard because he had to ensure the story stayed canonical to the DC Universe, something he did not have to worry about when writing _The Dark Knight Returns_. In addition, Miller's pacing would have to be altered because of ongoing series' relatively small page counts. O'Neil reasoned that _Crisis on Infinite Earths_ had completely remade the DC Universe, so Miller would be able to have the same creative freedom that _The Dark Knight Returns_ provided.[16] He also reassured Miller that he and Mazzucchelli "weren’t going to lose anything" by serializing it.[17]

Miller has said he kept Kane and Finger's basic story for "Year One" but expanded it.[18] In writing the story, Miller looked for parts of Batman's origin that were never explored. He left the core elements, such as the murder of Bruce's parents, intact, but reduced them to brief flashbacks. Bruce's globe-trotting adventures was something Miller removed, as he found uninteresting. Rather than portraying Batman as a larger-than-life icon as he had in _The Dark Knight Returns_, Miller chose to characterize "Year One{{"'}}s Batman as an average, inexperienced man trying to make a change in society because Miller believed a superhero is least interesting when most effective. Examples of this include Batman underestimating his opponents, getting shot by police, and his costume being too big. The story's violence was kept street-level and gritty, emphasizing noir and realism.[19]

In illustrating, Mazzucchelli sought to make "Year One" look grimy, dark, and muted. His interpretation of Gotham City was designed to symbolize corruption, featuring muddy colors that gave the impression of the city being dirty and needing a hero. The newsprint paper used in _Batman_ was unable to reproduce the bright coloring and visual effects of _The Dark Knight Returns_, so Mazzucchelli took on "Year One" with a more grounded and darker approach.[20]

Publication

In accordance with Wolfman's plans,[21] O'Neil initially saw "Year One" as the start of the second volume of _Batman_ and expected the first part to be its first issue. However, Miller rejected this idea. He explained: "I don't need to slash through continuity with as sharp a blade as I thought. Doing the _Dark Knight_ has shown me there's been enough good material ... I didn't feel that fleshing out an unknown part of Batman's history justified wiping out 50 years of [adventures]."[22] Thus, the four "Year One" issues bear no continuity to past issues of _Batman_.[23]

Collected editions

One of the earliest collections of "Year One" was released in _The Complete Frank Miller Batman_, published by Longmeadow Press in 1989.[24] A dedicated collected edition, _Batman: Year One_, was published as a trade paperback in October 1997 (). It is 96 pages long and contains the four "Year One" issues.

DC released a hardcover "deluxe edition" of _Batman: Year One_ () to coincide with the release of _Batman Begins_ in April 2005.[25] This release includes introductions by Miller and Mazzucchelli, the original penciled artwork, promotional and unseen Batman art, Lewis's color samples, and some pages of the original script, for a total of 144 pages. This edition was rereleased as a 136-page trade paperback in January 2007, with an introduction by O'Neil (). New versions of this edition were released in 2012[26] and 2017 ().

To celebrate Batman's 75th anniversary in November 2014, DC released a sample of "Year One" as a part of its _DC Comics Essentials_ line of promotional comics.[27] In 2015, a special package was released that contained the story and its film adaptation ().

In November 2016, DC released a 288-page DC Comics Absolute Edition of _Batman: Year One_. It comes in a slipcase with two hardcover books: one that reprints a remastered version of the story, with refined coloring; and another that reprints the original, unaltered story from 1987. Both books contain over 60 pages of bonus materials, including Miller's complete scripts.[28]


Plot

The story recounts the beginning of Bruce Wayne's career as Batman and Jim Gordon's with the Gotham City Police Department. Bruce Wayne returns home to Gotham City at the age of twenty-five from training abroad in martial arts, man-hunting, and science for the past 12 years, and James Gordon moves to Gotham City with his wife, Barbara, after a transfer from Chicago. Both are swiftly acquainted with the corruption and violence of Gotham City, with Gordon witnessing his partner Detective Arnold John Flass assaulting an African-American teen for fun.

After refusing a proposition from a teenage prostitute Holly Robinson, Bruce is reluctantly drawn into a brawl with her violent pimp and is attacked by several prostitutes, including dominatrix Selina Kyle. Two police officers shoot and take him in their squad car, but a dazed and bleeding Bruce breaks his handcuffs and causes a crash, dragging the police to a safe distance before fleeing. He reaches Wayne Manor barely alive and sits before his father's bust, requesting guidance in his war on crime. A bat crashes through a window and settles on the bust, giving him the inspiration to become the Batman.

Gordon soon works to rid corruption from the force, but, on orders from Commissioner Gillian Loeb, several officers attack him, including Flass, who personally threatens Gordon's pregnant wife. In revenge, the recovering Gordon tracks Flass down, beats him, and leaves him naked and handcuffed in the snow.

As Gordon becomes a minor celebrity for several brave acts, Batman strikes for the first time, attacking a group of thieves. Batman soon works up the ladder, even attacking Flass while the latter was accepting a drug dealer's bribe. After Batman interrupts a dinner party attended by many of Gotham's corrupt politicians and crime bosses to announce his intention to bring them to justice, including Carmine "The Roman" Falcone, Loeb orders Gordon to bring him in by any means necessary.

As Gordon tries in vain to catch him, Batman attacks Falcone, stripping him naked and tying him up in his bed and dumping his car in the river, infuriating the mob boss. Assistant District Attorney Harvey Dent becomes Batman's first ally, while Detective Sarah Essen and Gordon witness Batman save an old woman from a runaway truck, after Essen suggested Bruce Wayne as a Batman suspect. Essen holds Batman at gunpoint while Gordon is momentarily dazed, but Batman disarms her and flees to an abandoned building.

Claiming the building has been scheduled for demolition, Loeb orders a bomb to be dropped on it, forcing Batman into the fortified basement, where he abandons his utility belt as it catches fire. A SWAT team led by trigger-happy officer Branden is sent in and attempts to trap Batman in the basement. After tranquilizing Branden, Batman dodges bullets as Branden's team opens fire on him, barely managing to survive after two bullet wounds. Enraged as the team's carelessly fired bullets injure several people outside, Batman beats the team into submission and, after using a device to attract the bats of his cave to him, he flees amid the chaos. After witnessing him in action, Selina Kyle dons a costume of her own to begin a life of crime.

Gordon has a brief affair with Essen, while Batman intimidates a mob drug dealer for information. The dealer comes to Gordon to testify against Flass, who is brought up on charges. Upset with Gordon's exploits, Loeb blackmails Gordon against pressing charges with proof of his affair. After bringing Barbara with him to interview Bruce Wayne, investigating his connection to Batman, Gordon confesses the affair to her.

Batman sneaks into Falcone's manor, overhearing a plan against Gordon, but is interrupted when Selina Kyle, hoping to build a reputation after her robberies were pinned on Batman, attacks Falcone and his bodyguards, aided from afar by Batman. Identifying Falcone's plan as the morning comes, the uncostumed Bruce leaves to help.

While leaving home, Gordon spots a motorcyclist enter his garage. Suspicious, Gordon enters to see Johnny Vitti, Falcone's nephew, and his thugs holding his family hostage. Gordon decisively shoots the thugs and chases Vitti, who has fled with the baby. The mysterious motorcyclist, now revealed to the reader as Bruce Wayne, rushes out to chase Vitti. Gordon blows out Vitti's car tire on a bridge and the two fight hand-to-hand, with Gordon losing his glasses, before Vitti and James Gordon Jr. fall over the side. Bruce leaps over the railing and saves the baby. Gordon realizes that he is standing before an unmasked Batman, but says that he is "practically blind without [his] glasses", and lets Bruce go.

In the final scenes of the comic, Flass turns on Loeb, supplying Dent with evidence and testimony, and Loeb resigns. Gordon is promoted to captain and stands on the rooftop waiting to meet Batman to discuss somebody called the Joker, who is plotting to poison the reservoir.


Reception

DC's post-_Crisis on Infinite Earths_ revamp was a major success, raising sales 22% in the first year, and DC beat Marvel in direct market sales for the first time in August and September 1987.[29] The four "Year One" issues were no exception to this. Two years before the relaunch, _Batman_ had all-time low sales of 75,000 copies per month; "Year One" sold an average of 193,000 copies an issue, numbers not seen since the early 1970s. Despite this, it did not outsell other books like _Uncanny X-Men_, and the collected edition sold well but never matched the sales of _The Dark Knight Returns_.[30] The story, with its noir-inspired narrative and dirty violence, quickly caught the attention of readers.[31] The _Los Angeles Times_ wrote that "Year One" offered an interesting and entertaining update to the origin of Batman.[32]

"Year One{{"'}}s characterization, particularly that of Batman and Gordon, has been praised. Hilary Goldstein (_IGN_) compared their journey to friendship to the plot of the film _Serpico_; they found that the two characters' respective story arcs—with Gordon's "illustrat[ing] the corruption in Gotham" and Batman's detailing "the transformation from man to myth"—offered an exploration of Batman's world like no other.[33] Glenn Matchett (_ComicsVerse_) wrote that, unlike _The Dark Knight Returns_, "Year One{{"'}}s Batman is more vulnerable and inexperienced, which made the story more memorable.[34] Nick Roberts (_Geek Syndicate_) thought the characters seemed believable,[35] and comics historian Matthew K. Manning called the characterization realistic.[36]

The story's depiction of Gotham and dark tone has also been acclaimed. Journalist James Lovegrove described "Year One" as a "noir-inflected pulp tale of vigilantism and integrity, focused on a good man doing the right thing in a dirty world" and noted the brutality of its fight sequences.[37] Jason Serafino (_Complex_) wrote that by ignoring many of Batman's trademark gadgets and villains, Miller managed to present Batman in a relatable and thrilling way.[38] Goldstein found every moment memorable, writing "Miller does not waste a single panel" in presenting a gritty and dark story.[39] Matchett agreed; he offered particular praise for the scenes depicting Batman clashing with the police, calling them the moment Batman began to become a legend.[40]

Mazzucchelli's art was noted as a standout.[41][42]


Continuity

Before the New 52 in 2011, _Batman: Year One_ existed in the mainstream DC continuity, and in the same continuity as the other storylines in Miller's "Dark Knight Universe", consisting of _The Dark Knight Returns_, its sequel _The Dark Knight Strikes Again_, _The Dark Knight III: The Master Race_, _The Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade_, _Spawn/Batman_, and _All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder_.[43] However, following the New 52 reboot, _Batman: Zero Year_ replaced _Year One_ as the official origin for Batman and _Year One_ was relegated to the continuity of the other Frank Miller storylines.[44]

Following _Crisis on Infinite Earths_, DC rebooted many of its titles. _Year One_ was followed by _Batman: Year Two_, but the 1994 _Zero Hour: Crisis in Time_ crossover erased _Year Two_ from continuity. In another continuity re-arrangement, _Catwoman: Year One_ (_Catwoman Annual_ #2, 1995) posited that Selina Kyle had not actually been a prostitute, but, rather, a thief posing as one in order to commit crimes.

Launched in 1989, following the success of the film _Batman_, the title _Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight_ examines crime-fighting exploits primarily, not exclusively, from the first four to five years of Batman's career. This title rotated in creative teams and time placement, but several stories directly relate to the events of _Year One_, especially the first arc "Batman: Shaman". In 1996 and 99', Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale created _Batman: The Long Halloween_ and _Batman: Dark Victory_, two 13-issue maxiseries that recounted Batman's early years as a crime-fighter following the events of Miller's original story and retold the origins of Two-Face and Dick Grayson. The _Year One_ story was continued in the 2005 graphic novel _Batman: The Man Who Laughs_, following up on Gordon informing Batman about the Joker, and thus recounting their first official encounter. Two other stories, _Batman and the Monster Men_ and _Batman and the Mad Monk_ tie into the same time period of Batman's career, filling in the gap between Year One and the Man Who Laughs. The comics _Robin: Year One_ and _Batgirl: Year One_ describe his sidekicks' origin stories.


Sequels

Two sequels titled _Batman: Year Two_ and _Batman: Year Three_ were released in 1987 and 1989.


Adaptations

After the critical failure of _Batman & Robin_, several attempts were made to reboot the Batman film franchise with an adaptation of "Year One". Joss Whedon and Joel Schumacher both pitched their own takes.[45] In 2000, Warner Bros. hired Darren Aronofsky to write and direct _Batman: Year One_. The film was to be written by Miller, who finished an early draft of the script.[46][47] The script, however, was a loose adaptation, as it kept most of the themes and elements from the graphic novel but shunned other conventions that were otherwise integral to the character.[48] It was shelved by the studio in 2001,[49] after an individual who claimed to have read Miller's script published a negative review on _Ain't It Cool News_.[50] In 2016, Miller stated the film was canceled because of creative differences between him and Aronofsky: "It was the first time I worked on a Batman project with somebody whose vision of Batman was darker than mine. My Batman was too nice for him. We would argue about it, and I'd say, 'Batman wouldn't do that, he wouldn't torture anybody'".[51]

In 2005, Christopher Nolan began his series, with the reboot film _Batman Begins_, which draws inspiration from "Year One" and other stories.[52] _Batman Begins_ and its sequel _The Dark Knight_ are set during the same timespan and adopt several elements directly from the graphic novel. Major characters like Commissioner Loeb, Detective Flass and Carmine 'The Roman' Falcone are featured prominently in _Batman Begins_. Film critic Michael Dodd argued that with each major motion picture focused on the Dark Knight's origins, the odes and references to the _Year One_ comic increased. Comparing _Mask of the Phantasm_ with _Batman Begins_ he noted that "...Phantasm was a Batman story with _Year One_ elements, while _Batman Begins_ was a _Year One_ story with added features".[53]

In 2011, an animated adaptation was released as a DC Universe Animated Original Movie. It was produced by Bruce Timm, co-directed by Lauren Montgomery and Sam Liu.[54] It features the voices of Benjamin McKenzie as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Bryan Cranston as James Gordon, Eliza Dushku as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Katee Sackhoff as Sarah Essen, Grey DeLisle as Barbara Gordon, Jon Polito as Commissioner Loeb, Alex Rocco as Carmine 'The Roman' Falcone, and Jeff Bennett as Alfred Pennyworth.[55] The movie premiered at Comic-Con, with a Catwoman short shown in October.[56]

The second half of the fourth season of the Batman-based television series _Gotham_ is inspired by _Batman: Year One_.[57]
