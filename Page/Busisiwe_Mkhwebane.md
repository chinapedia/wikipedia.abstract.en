BUSISIWE MKHWEBANE is a South African advocate, who has served as the Public Protector since 2016.


Early life and education

Mkhwebane was born in Bethal in Mpumalanga on 2 February 1970, matriculating from Mkhephula Secondary School in 1988. She graduated with a BProc followed by an LLB from the University of the North (now the University of Limpopo). Subsequently, she obtained a diploma in corporate law and a higher diploma in tax from the Rand Afrikaans University (now the University of Johannesburg).[1] In 2010 she completed a Masters in Business Leadership at the University of South Africa.[2]


Career

In 1994 Mkhwebane joined the Department of Justice as a Public Prosecutor thereafter from 1996 as Legal Administrative Officer in the International Affairs Directorate. In 1998 she joined the South African Human Rights Commission as a senior researcher. The following year she joined the Public Protector's office as senior investigator and acting provincial representative. In 2005 she left to join the Department of Home Affairs as the director for refugee affairs, becoming acting chief director in asylum seekers management in 2009. From 2010 to 2014 she worked as Counselor Immigration and Civic Services in South Africa's embassy in China. In 2014 she returned to South Africa to serve as a director on country information and cooperation management at the Department of Home Affairs. Mkhwebane then worked as an analyst for the State Security Agency from July 2016 to October 2016 before she was appointed Public Protector in October 2016.

She served as a board member for the Refugee Fund, where payments for financial assistance are made for refugees in distress.[3] She serves as the Director of Business Development at Iyanilla Bricks.[4]

Controversies as Public Protector

In June 2017, with consultation from former South African Reserve Bank director (2003-2012), Stephen Goodson, and without consultation with government economists or legal scholars, Mkhwebane drafted changes to the Constitution to nationalize and remove the independence of the South African Reserve Bank and its mandate to keep inflation under control; she then ordered Parliament to make those changes in the Constitution.[5] The resultant loss of confidence in South Africa's governmental bonds caused the loss of millions of rand.[6] In August 2017 the Reserve Bank won its lawsuit against Mkhwebane and vacated her _order_ as violative of separation of powers.[7]

In 2017 Mkhwebane issued a report, the Bankorp-CIEX report, on her investigation into among others, Absa Bank.[8] The Pretoria High Court set aside her order for Absa Bank to refund R1.125-billion to the government for the financial assistance bailout that its predecessor Bankorp Group had received from the former government.[9] The court found that _The public protector did not conduct herself in a manner which would be expected from a person occupying the office of the public protector,_ it further stated: _She did not have regard thereto that her office requires her to be objective, honest and to deal with matters according to the law and that a higher standard is expected of her._[10] The court assessed some costs of the case _personally_ against Mkhwebane due to her conduct.[11][12] The personal costs order was later upheld by the Constitutional Court.[13]

In May 2019, Mkhwebane's report into the Vrede Dairy Project was declared unconstitutional and set aside, with the Gauteng High Court finding that the Public Protector had failed in her duties to investigate the project.[14]
