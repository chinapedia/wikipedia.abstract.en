LEON SRABIAN HERALD (born LEON DER SRABIAN; 15 May 1896 – 7 September 1976) was an Armenian-American poet who wrote the first English-language by an Armenian author on the subject of the Armenian Genocide.[1][2]


Biography

Background

Herald was born in Put-Aringe, near Erzincan in 1896. In 1912, he emigrated with his family to America.[3][4]

He worked briefly in car factories in Detroit. Then, in the early 1920s, he attended the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he befriended Zona Gale and Marianne Moore, fellow poet and editor of _The Dial_ literary magazine. He wrote poems and reviews for the _Wisconsin State Journal_.[5][6] He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1923.[7]

Career

In 1925, Herald published a first book of poems, _This Waking Hour_. _The Dial_ serialized his memoirs monthly from December 1926 to June 1927, which describe his home village, education in Cairo, and travel to the States.

Later that year he moved to New York, where he lived almost all his life.[8]

In 1926, he attended the MacDowell Colony in Peterboro, New Hampshire. In 1928, he attended the Yaddo Colony in Saratoga Springs, New York.[9][10]

In 1927, he worked in the New York Public Library with Whittaker Chambers.[11]

During the 1920s and 1930s, he published in _The Nation_, _The New Republic_, _Commonweal_, _Poetry_, and _Ararat_ (Armenian quarterly).[12]

His story "Power of Horizon" appeared in Edward J. O'Brien's collections of _Best Short Stories of 1929_. Work also appeared in _Armenian-American Poets: A Bilingual Anthology_ and in William S. Braithwaite's _Anthology of Magazine Verse_.[13]

In 1935, he helped form the Federal Writers' Project.[14][15]

At some time, he served as editor of two for Armenian-American publications: _Youth_ (weekly) and ''Learning'm (journal).[16]


Communism

Herald was "always an advocate of the working class."[17]

In the late 1920s, he joined the John Reed Club. He was a delegate to Club's 1932 national convention (and claimed to have traveled with Whittaker Chambers, which Allen Weinstein claimed was not possible).[18]

He was a member of the CPUSA-led League of American Writers (1935-1943).

In the 1960s, Herald later provided this information to Meyer Zeligs, a psychoanalyst who wrote a pscyho-biography called _Friendship and Fratricide_ about Whittaker Chambers. Herald told Zeligs that Chambers had tried to sleep with him in 1932, demonstrating homosexuality. Zeligs claimed he had not hidden his identity – but in fact had written his name as "Leon S. Herald" whereas the poet was well known under his full name in America as "Leon Srabian Herald."[19][20][21][22]


Personal and death

In 1915, Herald lost his family in Armenia during the Armenian Genocide.[23]

In 1938, he married Betty Forster. In 1939 they had a son, John Whittier Herald, known professionally as folk bard John Herald. In 1942, his wife died of cancer.[24]

In 1946, he had a nervous breakdown. He suffered thereafter for the rest of his life from insomnia.[25]

He died in 1976.[26]

Herald dedicated his only book of poetry "To Those Disinherited of Life in 1915," making him "the very first work in English by an Armenian author, encompassing the subject" of the Armenian Genocide.[27]
