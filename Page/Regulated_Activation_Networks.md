Regulated Activation Networks(RANs), is a computational cognitive model. This modelling approach is based upon the Principles of Regulated Activation Networks(PRANs),[1][2] which are summarized as:

-   The model must have a dynamic topology.
-   The model must be capable creating abstract concepts.
-   The model must be able to learn association among the concepts.
-   The model must exhibit time-variant activation states.
