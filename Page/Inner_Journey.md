_INNER JOURNEY_ is an album by American pianist Hal Galper released on the Mainstream label in 1973.[1][2][3]


Critical reception

The Allmusic review by Ken Dryden states "Hal Galper's third album as a leader, which also was his third and final recording for the Mainstream label, finds him making a bit of a change. It was at this point in his career that he made a clean break from playing electric piano at all, becoming exclusively an acoustic pianist ... it remains one of the very best recording from Hal Galper's early days as a leader".[4]
