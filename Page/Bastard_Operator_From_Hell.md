The BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL (BOFH) is a fictional rogue computer operator who takes out his anger on users and others who pester him with their computer problems, uses his expertise against his enemies and manipulates his employer.[1][2]

Several other people have written stories about BOFHs, but those by Simon Travaglia are considered canonical.[3] The BOFH stories were originally posted in 1992 to Usenet by Travaglia, with some being reprinted in _Datamation._[4] They were published weekly from 1995 to 1999 in _Network Week._[5] Since 2000 they have been published regularly in _The Register_ (UK).[6] Several collections of the stories have been published as books.

By extension, the term is also used to refer to any system administrator who displays the qualities of the original.[7][8]

The early accounts of the BOFH took place in a university; later the scenes were set in an office workplace. In 2000 (BOFH 2k), the BOFH and his pimply-faced youth (PFY) assistant moved to a new company.


Other characters

-   The PFY (Pimply-Faced Youth, the assistant to the BOFH. The real name is Stephen[9]) Possesses a temperament similar to the BOFH, and often either teams up with and/or plots against him.
-   The Boss (often portrayed as having no IT knowledge but believing otherwise; identity changes as successive bosses are sacked, leave, are committed, or have nasty "accidents")
-   CEO of the company â€” The PFY's uncle Brian[10] from 1996 until 2000, when the BOFH and PFY moved to a new company.[11]
-   The Head of IT, almost as disposable as the Boss.
-   The help desk operators, referred to as the "Helldesk" and often scolded for giving out the BOFH's personal number.
-   The Boss's secretary, Sharon.
-   The security department [12]
-   George, the cleaner (an invaluable source of information to the BOFH and PFY)[13]

The main protagonist in Charles Stross's _The Laundry Files_ series of novels named himself Bob Oliver Francis Howard in reference to the BOFH. As Bob Howard is a self-chosen pseudonym, and Bob is a network manager when not working as a computational demonologist, the name is all too appropriate. In the novella 'Pimpf' he acquires a pimply-faced young assistant by the name of Peter-Fred Young.
