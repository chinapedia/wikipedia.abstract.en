Directors

Dr Kamal Ahuja is the company Director and HFEA Licence Holder for the London Women's Clinic[5] In the 1990s Dr Kamal Ahuja, who was a former research student of IVF physiologist Robert Edwards,[6] pioneered egg sharing at the London Women's Clinic.[7]


Success Rates

According to HFEA figures, success rates for the London Women’s Clinic group are broadly at, or above the national average. In 2015 London Women’s Clinic Wales achieved success rates of 31% of births per embryo transferred, vs. a national average of 27% for women under 38 years old. The Darlington clinic reached 33%, and the Harley St. clinic 23%.


Controversies

In 2014 the Clinic admitted that it had failed in its duty of care to a client who was given sperm that was incorrectly screened as 'normal' when it was known to be 'abnormal'. LWC reached an out of Court settlement with the affected family[8]. The clinic, was warned by the HFEA after inspectors found LWC staff failed to carry out "a number of witnessing stages", vital to ensure sperm is screened correctly[9].

Undercover Daily Mail reporters exposed a 'cash for eggs' scandal in 2017. The clinic was accused of exploiting low income women with fertility issue to secure profits on the resale of their eggs[10]. After reviewing the evidence Lord Winston went on record to say: ‘I fear that some in my profession have no moral or ethical compass,’ whilst Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the Mail’s findings were ‘serious and worrying’[11].


LWC Foundation

The LWC Foundation was founded in 2010 and provides grants to individuals and educational establishments in support of scientific research in reproductive medicine. The Centre for Family Research at the University of Cambridge and Swansea University were the first two establishments to be chosen as grant recipients, both of whose areas of research are closely associated with the LWC.

In addition the LWC Foundation has also made a grant to a charity called Vidya that runs educational establishments for underprivileged children in New Delhi.
