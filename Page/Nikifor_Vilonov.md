Вилонов_Никифор_Ефремович.jpg NIKIFOR EFREMOVIC VILONOV () (1883-1910) was a Russian revolutionary affiliated to the Bolsheviks who was imprisoned and then forced into exile, dying in Davos, Switzerland in 1910.[1] He wrote philosophical tracts which influenced Alexander Bogdanov and was secretary of the Capri Party School established by Bogdanov, Lunacharsky and Gorky in 1909.[2] Nevertheless, he sided with Lenin during the Bogdanov-Lenin philosophical dispute.

Vilonov was a mechanic at the Kaluga railway station in 1901-2. However he joined the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party and was soon a very effective agitator and organiser.[3] He was particularly active in the general strike of 1903, which led to his arrest. During the 1905 Revolution he was chair person of the Samara Soviet.[4] He married Mariia Zolina, and kept on touch with her while abroad.[5]
