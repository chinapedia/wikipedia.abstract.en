__ ( , , ;[1] _nirvāṇa_ ; _nibbāna_; _ṇivvāṇa_, literally "blown out", as in an oil lamp[2]) is commonly associated with Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, and represents its ultimate state of soteriological release, the liberation from repeated rebirth in _saṃsāra_.[3][4][5]

In Indian religions, _nirvana_ is synonymous with _moksha_ and _mukti_. All Indian religions assert it to be a state of perfect quietude, freedom, highest happiness as well as the liberation from or ending of _samsara_, the repeating cycle of birth, life and death.[6][7]

However, Buddhist and non-Buddhist traditions describe these terms for liberation differently.[8] In the Buddhist context, _nirvana_ refers to realization of non-self and emptiness, marking the end of rebirth by stilling the _fires_ that keep the process of rebirth going.[9][10][11] In Hindu philosophy, it is the union of or the realization of the identity of Atman with Brahman, depending on the Hindu tradition.[12][13] In Jainism, it is also the soteriological goal, it represents the release of a soul from karmic bondage and samsara.[14]


Etymology

The word _nirvāṇa_, states Steven Collins, is from the verbal root _vā_ "blow" in the form of past participle _vāna_ "blown", prefixed with the preverb _nis_ meaning "out". Hence the original meaning of the word is "blown out, extinguished". Sandhi changes the sounds: the _v_ of _vāna_ causes _nis_ to become _nir_, and then the _r_ of _nir_ causes retroflexion of the following _n_: _nis+vāna_ > _nirvāṇa_.

The term _nirvana_ in the soteriological sense of "blown out, extinguished" state of liberation does not appear in the Vedas nor in the Upanishads. According to Collins, "the Buddhists seem to have been the first to call it _nirvana_."[15] However, the ideas of spiritual liberation using different terminology, with the concept of soul and Brahman, appears in Vedic texts and Upanishads, such as in verse 4.4.6 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.[16] This may have been deliberate use of words in early Buddhism, suggests Collins, since Atman and Brahman were described in Vedic texts and Upanishads with the imagery of fire, as something good, desirable and liberating.[17]


Origins

_Nirvāṇa_ is a term found in the texts of all major Indian religions – Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism[18] and Sikhism.[19][20] It refers to the profound peace of mind that is acquired with _moksha_, liberation from samsara, or release from a state of suffering, after respective spiritual practice or sādhanā.

The idea of _moksha_ is connected to the Vedic culture, where it conveyed a notion of _amrtam_, "immortality", and also a notion of a _timeless_, "unborn", or "the still point of the turning world of time". It was also its timeless structure, the whole underlying "the spokes of the invariable but incessant wheel of time". The hope for life after death started with notions of going to the worlds of the Fathers or Ancestors and/or the world of the Gods or Heaven.

The earliest Vedic texts incorporate the concept of life, followed by an afterlife in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit).[21] However, the ancient Vedic Rishis challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic, because people do not live an equally moral or immoral life. Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and either permanent heaven or permanent hell is disproportionate. The Vedic thinkers introduced the idea of an afterlife in heaven or hell in proportion to one's merit, and when this runs out, one returns and is reborn.[22][23] The idea of rebirth following "running out of merit" appears in Buddhist texts as well.[24] This idea appears in many ancient and medieval texts, as _Saṃsāra_, or the endless cycle of life, death, rebirth and redeath, such as section 6:31 of the _Mahabharata_ and verse 9.21 of the _Bhagavad Gita_.[25][26] The Saṃsara, the life after death, and what impacts rebirth came to be seen as dependent on karma.

The liberation from Saṃsāra _d_eveloped as an ultimate goal and soteriological value in the Indian culture, and called by different terms such as nirvana, moksha, mukti and kaivalya. This basic scheme underlies Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, where "the ultimate aim is the timeless state of _moksa_, or, as the Buddhists first seem to have called it, nirvana."

Although the term occurs in the literatures of a number of ancient Indian traditions, the concept is most commonly associated with Buddhism.[27] It was later adopted by other Indian religions, but with different meanings and description (_Moksha_), such as in the Hindu text _Bhagavad Gita_ of the _Mahabharata_.


Buddhism

entering nirvana, Dharma assembly pavilion, Wat Botum Wattey Reacheveraram, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.]] Nirvana (_nibbana_) literally means "blowing out" or "quenching".[28] It is the most used as well as the earliest term to describe the soteriological goal in Buddhism: release from the cycle of rebirth (_saṃsāra_). Nirvana is part of the Third Truth on "cessation of dukkha" in the Four Noble Truths doctrine of Buddhism. It is the goal of the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Buddha is believed in the Buddhist scholastic tradition to have realized two types of nirvana, one at enlightenment, and another at his death. The first is called _sopadhishesa-nirvana_ (nirvana with a remainder), the second _parinirvana_ or _anupadhishesa-nirvana_ (nirvana without remainder, or final nirvana).

In the Buddhist tradition, nirvana is described as the extinguishing of the _fires_ that cause rebirths and associated suffering.[29] The Buddhist texts identify these three "three fires" or "three poisons" as _raga_ (greed, sensuality), _dvesha_ (aversion, hate) and _avidyā_ or _moha_ (ignorance, delusion).

The state of nirvana is also described in Buddhism as cessation of all afflictions, cessation of all actions, cessation of rebirths and suffering that are a consequence of afflictions and actions. Liberation is described as identical to _anatta_ (_anatman_, non-self, lack of any self).[30][31] In Buddhism, liberation is achieved when all things and beings are understood to be with no Self.[32][33] Nirvana is also described as identical to achieving _sunyata_ (emptiness), where there is no essence or fundamental nature in anything, and everything is empty.[34][35]

In time, with the development of Buddhist doctrine, other interpretations were given, such as being an unconditioned state,[36] a fire going out for lack of fuel, abandoning weaving (_vana_) together of life after life, and the elimination of desire.[37] However, Buddhist texts have asserted since ancient times that nirvana is more than "destruction of desire", it is "the object of the knowledge" of the Buddhist path.


Hinduism

The most ancient texts of Hinduism such as the Vedas and early Upanishads don't mention the soteriological term _Nirvana_. This term is found in texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Nirvana Upanishad, likely composed in the post-Buddha era. The concept of Nirvana is described differently in Buddhist and Hindu literature. Hinduism has the concept of Atman – the soul, self[38][39][40] – asserted to exist in every living being, while Buddhism asserts through its _anatman_ doctrine that there is no Atman in any being.[41][42] Nirvana in Buddhism is "stilling mind, cessation of desires, and action" unto emptiness, states Jeaneane Fowler, while nirvana in post-Buddhist Hindu texts is also "stilling mind but not inaction" and "not emptiness", rather it is the knowledge of true Self (Atman) and the acceptance of its universality and unity with metaphysical Brahman.

Moksha

The ancient soteriological concept in Hinduism is moksha, described as the liberation from the cycle of birth and death through self-knowledge and the eternal connection of Atman (soul, self) and metaphysical Brahman. Moksha is derived from the root _muc*_ () which means free, let go, release, liberate; Moksha means "liberation, freedom, emancipation of the soul".[43][44] In the Vedas and early Upanishads, the word mucyate ()[45] appears, which means to be set free or release - such as of a horse from its harness.

The traditions within Hinduism state that there are multiple paths (_marga_) to moksha: _jnana-marga_, the path of knowledge; _bhakti-marga_, the path of devotion; and _karma-marga_, the path of action.[46]

Brahma-nirvana in the _Bhagavad Gita_

The term Brahma-nirvana appears in verses 2.72 and 5.24-26 of the Bhagavad Gita.[47] It is the state of release or liberation; the union with the Brahman.[48] According to Easwaran, it is an experience of blissful egolessness.

According to Zaehner, Johnson and other scholars, _nirvana_ in the Gita is a Buddhist term adopted by the Hindus. Zaehner states it was used in Hindu texts for the first time in the Bhagavad Gita, and that the idea therein in verse 2.71-72 to "suppress one's desires and ego" is also Buddhist. According to Johnson the term _nirvana_ is borrowed from the Buddhists to confuse the Buddhists, by linking the Buddhist nirvana state to the pre-Buddhist Vedic tradition of metaphysical absolute called Brahman.

According to Mahatma Gandhi, the Hindu and Buddhist understanding of _nirvana_ are different because the nirvana of the Buddhists is shunyata, emptiness, but the nirvana of the Gita means peace and that is why it is described as brahma-nirvana (oneness with Brahman).[49]


Jainism

Uttaradhyana Sutra provides an account of Sudharman – also called Gautama, and one of the disciples of Mahavira – explaining the meaning of nirvana to Kesi, a disciple of Parshva.[52]


Manichaenism

The term _Nirvana_ (also mentioned is _parinirvana_) in the thirteenth or fourtheenth century Manichaean work "The great song to Mani" and "The story of the Death of Mani", referring to the _realm of light_.[53]


Sikhism

The concept of liberation as "extinction of suffering", along with the idea of _sansara_ as the "cycle of rebirth" is also part of Sikhism.[54] Nirvana appears in Sikh texts as the term _Nirban_.[55][56] However, the more common term is _Mukti_ or _Moksh_,[57] a salvation concept wherein loving devotion to God is emphasized for liberation from endless cycle of rebirths.[58]

[35] , Quote (p 59-60): "We may better understand what anatman implies if we examine Nagarjuna's concept of the void: shunyata or emptiness. Nagarjuna argued that there is no such thing as the fundamental nature, or essence, of anything. (...) In a word, all is emptiness, shunyata; instead of essence, there is a void. (...) everything is empty."; Quote (p 136): "What we can say, whichever branch of Buddhism we may have in mind, is that the state of nirvana, to which all Buddhists aspire, is like samadhi, a non-dual state. (...) the Buddhist concept of enlightened mind - bodhichitta - refers to a state beyond desire (dukkha) whereby the one who seeks nirvana has achieved shunyata, the emptiness or void described on pages 58-9."
