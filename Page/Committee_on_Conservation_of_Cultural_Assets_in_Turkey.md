After the establishment of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in 1971, the department became an office of this new ministry. Following a series of name changes, finally in 2003, it was renamed "Cultural Assets and Museums Department" ().[1] The Committees on Conservation of Cultural Assets are province-based subdivisions of this department at the ministry.
