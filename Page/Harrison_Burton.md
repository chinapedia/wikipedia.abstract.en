HARRISON BRIAN BURTON (born October 9, 2000) is an American professional stock car racing driver. He currently competes full-time in the NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series, driving the No. 18 Toyota Tundra for Kyle Busch Motorsports, part-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series driving the No. 18 Toyota Supra for Joe Gibbs Racing, and part-time in the ARCA Menards Series, driving the No. 20 Toyota Camry for Venturini Motorsports.[1][2]


Racing career

Early years

Burton's racing career started off when he received a go-kart at age two, which later turned in to a quarter midget at age four.[3] After starting to race them at age twelve, Burton won his first late model race in early 2014.[4] His first super late model win came in early 2015, at New Smyrna Speedway.[5][6] He was also for three years a USAC quarter midget championship. At age 11, he grabbed his first late model pole at Ace Speedway, and at twelve won two races in pro late models.[7]

CARS Super Late Model Tour

The Charlotte, North Carolina native made his CARS debut in 2015, running six of the series' ten races. Finishing only two of those races, he finished third at Southern National Motorsports Park and fourth at Concord Speedway.[8] In the middle of that season, the team switched car bodies and crew chiefs, hiring former Xfinity Series driver Chris Wimmer.[9] Switching his focus to the NASCAR K&N Pro Series East, he only ran three of eight races in 2016, recording two top ten finishes.[10]

ARCA Racing Series

In his ARCA Racing Series debut for Ranier Racing with MDM, Burton started sixth and finished third after almost being spun out by eventual race winner Chase Briscoe.[11][12] Returning in 2017 with MDM Motorsports, Burton chased down Dalton Sargeant on the final run of the race at Toledo Speedway to win in only his second series start.[13] He later won in his superspeedway debut, which came at Pocono Raceway in 2018. Burton dedicated the win to John Andretti, who is currently battling cancer.[14]

On January 8, 2018, it was announced that Burton would run a partial ARCA schedule with MDM in 2018.[15]

On January 10, 2019, it was announced that Burton will drive the Venturini Motorsports No. 20 Toyota for five races in 2019.[16] Burton won on his superspeedway debut at Daytona.

K&N Pro Series East

Starting with the 2016 NASCAR K&N Pro Series East season opener at New Smyrna, Burton became the youngest driver to start a race in the series. He also garnered a full-time ride from HScott Motorsports using their Toyotas.[17] Throughout the thirteen race season, Burton garnered one pole, as many top fives, and finished eighth in the championship point standings while failing to finish two races.[18] After HScott Motorsports with Justin Marks shut down, Burton moved to MDM Motorsports bringing his number and sponsor.[19] He also signed an extension with Kevin Harvick Incorporated to bring in sponsors like DEX Imaging, Hunt Brothers Pizza, Rheem and others.[20] Early in the season, Burton made waves by campaigning a paint scheme with the number on the rear quarter panels.[21] His performance also gained attention, winning a rain-shortened race at Bristol.[22] He then outlasted the field at Memphis the following race after Todd Gilliland had a flat tire.[23] He went on to win five of fourteen races that season[24] and beat Gilliland for the championship after making up an eight-point deficit going into the final race.[25]

Gander Outdoors Truck Series

Burton signed on with Kyle Busch Motorsports to drive the No. 18 Toyota Tundra for the 2016 Alpha Energy Solutions 250 at Martinsville Speedway in late October. Due to NASCAR rules and regulations maintaining that a driver has to be sixteen years of age before competing in any national series event, Burton was therefore barred from entering any events before October 9 of that year.[27] He showed speed early, cracking the top ten in practice, but faltered during the race and finished one lap down in 22nd.[28][29] Burton signed with Kyle Busch Motorsports to run both Martinsville races, as well as Dover, Iowa, Eldora, and Bristol in the No. 51 Toyota Tundra in 2017.[30] He finished all of the races but only scored one top-ten, a fourth place at Martinsville in fall.[31]

On January 8, 2018, it was announced that Burton would again pilot the KBM No. 51 for a partial schedule. The nine-race schedule included mostly short tracks but also Canadian Tire Motorsport Park and all of the races after he turns eighteen.[32] Burton grabbed his first pole in the M&M's 200, and finished third after dealing with throttle issues during the race.[33] He won his first stage in NASCAR competition at ISM Raceway in November en route to another third place finish.[34]

On November 14, 2018, it was announced that Burton would run full-time in 2019, replacing Noah Gragson in KBM's No. 18 entry.[35]

Xfinity Series

On April 1, 2019, Joe Gibbs Racing announced Burton would drive the team's No. 18 Toyota Camry in the NASCAR Xfinity Series for eight races starting with the Alsco 300 at Bristol Motor Speedway five days later.[36] In his third race of the year at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Burton was intentionally wrecked by Paul Menard after Burton passed Menard with contact. Menard thought the incident was a teaching moment to not race dirty while Burton was from the viewpoint that getting passed was not grounds for being wrecked.[37]


Personal life

Burton attends the Cannon School while racing.[38] He is the son of former NASCAR driver and current NASCAR on NBC analyst Jeff Burton, nephew of former driver Ward Burton and cousin of current driver Jeb Burton.[39]
