SIGGRAPH (Special Interest Group on Computer GRAPHics and Interactive Techniques) is the annual conference on computer graphics (CG) convened by the ACM SIGGRAPH organization. The first SIGGRAPH conference was in 1974. The conference is attended by tens of thousands of computer professionals. Past conferences have been held in Los Angeles, Dallas, New Orleans, Boston, Vancouver, and elsewhere in North America. SIGGRAPH Asia, a second yearly conference, has been held since 2008 in various Asian countries. The strength of SIGGRAPH comes from the chapters[1] set all around the world.


Overview

Dozens of research papers are presented each year, and SIGGRAPH is widely considered the top forum for the publication of computer graphics research.[2][3][4] The recent paper acceptance rate for SIGGRAPH has been less than 26%.[5] The submitted papers are peer-reviewed in a single-blind process.[6] There has been some criticism about the preference of SIGGRAPH paper reviewers for novel results rather than useful incremental progress.[7][8] The papers accepted for presentation at SIGGRAPH are printed since 2003 in a special issue of the _ACM Transactions on Graphics_ journal. Prior to 1992, SIGGRAPH papers were printed as part of the _Computer Graphics_ publication; between 1993 and 2001, there was a dedicated _SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings_ series of publications.[9]

In addition to the papers, there are numerous panels of industry experts set up to discuss a wide variety of topics, from computer graphics to machine interactivity to education. SIGGRAPH also offers many full- and half-day courses in state-of-the-art computer graphics topics, as well as shorter "sketch" presentations where artists and researchers discuss their latest work.

In 1984, under LucasFilm Computer Group, John Lasseter's first computer animated short, _The Adventures of Andr√© & Wally B._, premiered at SIGGRAPH. Pixar's first computer animated short, _Luxo, Jr._ debuted in 1986. Pixar has debuted numerous shorts at the conference since.[10]

SIGGRAPH has several awards programs to recognize outstanding contributions to computer graphics. The most prestigious is the Steven Anson Coons Award for Outstanding Creative Contributions to Computer Graphics. It has been awarded every two years since 1983 to recognize an individual's lifetime achievement in computer graphics.
