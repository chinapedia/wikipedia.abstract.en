DANA MICHELLE PLATO (born DANA MICHELLE STRAIN; November 7, 1964 – May 8, 1999) was an American actress known for her role as Kimberly Drummond on the U.S. television sitcom _Diff'rent Strokes_ from 1978 to 1986.[1] After leaving the cast of _Diff'rent Strokes_, Plato attempted to establish herself as a working actress, with mixed success: she worked sporadically in made-for-TV movies and in independent films, and did voice-over work. At the age of 34, after years of struggling with poverty and substance abuse, Plato died from an overdose of prescription drugs.[2][3]


Early life

Plato was born Dana Michelle Strain on November 7, 1964 in Maywood, California to Linda Strain, an unwed teenager who already was caring for an 18-month-old child. In June 1965, the seven-month-old Dana was adopted by Dean Plato, who owned a trucking company, and his wife Florine "Kay" Plato.[4] Plato was raised in the San Fernando Valley. When she was three, her adoptive parents divorced, and she lived with her mother.[5]


Career

When she was very young, Plato began attending auditions with her mother and from age seven began appearing in television commercials, in which she reportedly appeared in over 100 commercials. Plato made her film debut at age 13 in the horror film _Return to Boggy Creek_ (1977).[6] Other early credits included _Exorcist II: The Heretic_ (1977) and _California Suite_ (1978).

In addition to acting, Plato was an accomplished figure skater, and at one point she trained for a possible Olympic team spot. It was during this time that she made a brief appearance on TV's _The Gong Show_ and was spotted by a producer who helped her secure what became her most famous acting role as Kimberly Drummond on _Diff'rent Strokes._ According to Plato, her mother decided she should cut back on her skating in order to focus on the TV role.


_Diff'rent Strokes_

_Diff'rent Strokes_ debuted on NBC in 1978, becoming an immediate hit. The show features Phillip Drummond (Conrad Bain), a wealthy white widower in New York City who adopts two black boys after their parents' deaths. Plato played Kimberly, Drummond's teenage daughter, who at the start of the show becomes the adoptive sister of the two boys, Willis (Todd Bridges) and Arnold (Gary Coleman). Plato appeared on the show from 1978 until 1984 and again from 1985 to 1986; during her tenure the show appeared on two different networks.

During her years on _Diff'rent Strokes_, Plato struggled with drug and alcohol problems. She admitted to drinking alcohol, and using cannabis and cocaine, and she suffered an overdose of diazepam when she was 14.[7] In December 1983, Plato moved in with her boyfriend, rock guitarist Lanny Lambert. The couple married on April 24, 1984, and their only child, Tyler Edward Lambert, was born on July 2, 1984.[8][9] During this time, Plato was let go from _Diff'rent Strokes_ because the producers did not feel that a pregnancy would fit the show's wholesome image. Although rumors of drug use and other problems on the set surrounded her dismissal, the producers were adamant that Plato's pregnancy was the only reason her character was written out. She returned for six guest appearances during the show's seventh and eighth seasons. In the season 8 episode that aired on January 17, 1986—Plato's final appearance on the show—Kimberly suffers from the effects of bulimia.


After _Diff'rent Strokes_

After leaving _Diff'rent Strokes_, Plato attempted to establish herself as a serious actress but found it difficult to achieve success outside of her sitcom career. She had breast implants and modeled for a June 1989 _Playboy_ pictorial, but her career remained in stagnation, and she started taking roles in such B-movies as _Bikini Beach Race_ (1989) and _Lethal Cowboy_ (1992).

Plato separated from Lambert in January 1988, the same week her mother died of scleroderma. In desperation over these traumatic events, she signed over power of attorney to an accountant who disappeared with the majority of her money, leaving her with no more than $150,000. She claimed the accountant was never found nor prosecuted, despite an exhaustive search, and that he had also stolen more than $11 million of other people's money.[10]

During her March 1990 divorce, Plato lost custody of her son to Lambert and was given visitation rights.[11][12] She moved to Las Vegas, where she struggled with poverty and unemployment. At one point she worked at a dry-cleaning store, where customers reported being impressed by her lack of airs.[13]

On February 28, 1991, she entered a video store, produced a pellet gun, and demanded the money in the cash register. The clerk called 9-1-1 and said "I've just been robbed by the girl who played Kimberly on _Diff'rent Strokes_." Approximately 15 minutes after the robbery, Plato returned to the scene and was immediately arrested. The robbery netted Plato $164.[14] Las Vegas entertainer Wayne Newton posted her $13,000 bail,[15] and Plato was given five years' probation. Plato made headlines and became a subject of the national debate surrounding troubled child stars, particularly given the difficulties of her _Diff'rent Strokes_ co-stars Gary Coleman and Todd Bridges. In January 1992, she was arrested again, this time for forging a prescription for diazepam. She served 30 days in jail for violating the terms of her probation and immediately entered a drug rehabilitation program.

In 1992, Plato was one of the first celebrities to star in a video game. The game, _Night Trap_, was not a great success (the majority of the game's video content was actually filmed in 1987 then shelved), but is considered a pioneering title because it was the first game to use live actors, specifically a well-known personality.[16] Controversy over the violence and sexuality, along with that surrounding _Mortal Kombat_, eventually led to the creation of the ESRB.[17]

Toward the end of her career, Plato chose roles that could be considered erotic, softcore pornography.[18] She appeared nude in _Prime Suspect_ (1989) and _Compelling Evidence_ (1995), and in the softcore erotic drama _Different Strokes: The Story of Jack and Jill...and Jill_ (1998), whose title was changed after filming in order to tie it to Plato's past. Following her appearance in the film, in the same year, Plato appeared in a cover story of the lesbian lifestyle magazine _Girlfriends_, in which she came out as a lesbian, although she later recanted.

She became engaged to Fred Potts, a filmmaker, but the romance soon ended.[19] Just before her death, she was engaged to her manager Robert Menchaca, with whom she lived in a motor home in Navarre, Florida.[20]

On May 7, 1999, the day before she died, Plato appeared on _The Howard Stern Show_. She spoke about her life, discussing her financial problems and past run-ins with the law. She admitted to being a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, but claimed she had been sober for more than 10 years by that point, and was not using any drugs, with the exception of prescribed painkillers due to the recent extraction of her wisdom teeth.[21] Many callers insulted her and questioned her sobriety, which provoked a defiant Plato who offered to take a drug test on the air. Some callers, as well as host Howard Stern, came to Plato's defense.[22] Although she allowed a hair to be cut for the test, Stern later claimed she asked for it back after the interview.[23]


Personal life

Plato married Lanny Lambert in 1984 and the couple had one son. The couple divorced in 1990, and Lambert was given custody of their son.[24]


Death

On May 8, 1999, Plato and Menchaca were returning to California and stopped at Menchaca's mother's home in Moore, Oklahoma for a Mother's Day visit.[25] Plato went to lie down inside her Winnebago motor home parked outside the house, where she died of an overdose of the painkiller Lortab and the muscle-relaxant Soma.[26] Her death subsequently was ruled a suicide.[27][28] Her body was cremated and her ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean.[29]
