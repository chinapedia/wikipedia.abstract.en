MARQUIS JUNIEL BUNDY (born August 5, 1994) is an American football wide receiver for the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He played college football at New Mexico and was signed by the Arizona Cardinals as an undrafted free agent in 2016.


College career

Bundy attended the University of New Mexico from 2012 to 2015. During his four-year career at New Mexico, he caught a total of 31 passes and two touchdowns. He had his breakout year during his sophomore season in 2013, catching 19 passes and two touchdowns.[1]


Professional career

With no eligibility remaining, Bundy entered the 2016 NFL Draft, but was projected to go undrafted due to having minimal results in college. Although he was the starting receiver at New Mexico, he was limited to only 31 catches in his career, due to the Lobos utilizing a run-heavy based offensive scheme. Bundy was not invited to combine, but did perform very well at New Mexico's Pro Day. With his physical attributes and his workouts, he began to receive attention as a possible seventh round selection or undrafted free agent prospect. The Carolina Panthers and Arizona Cardinals showed the most interest in Bundy after his pro day workout.[2]

Arizona Cardinals

As expected, Bundy went undrafted in the 2016 NFL draft. On June 2, 2016, the Arizona Cardinals signed him as an undrafted free agent.[3] He played in all four preseason games and made nine catches for 97 yards.[4] On September 3, 2016, he was cut by the Arizona Cardinals as part of the final roster cuts.[5] On September 13, 2016, the Cardinals signed Bundy to their practice squad after wide receiver Chris Hubert was promoted to their active roster.[6] On November 25, 2016, Bundy was promoted to the active roster after the Cardinals released Hubert.[7]

On August 18, 2017, Bundy was waived by the Cardinals.[8]

New York Giants

On August 23, 2017, Bundy signed with the New York Giants.[9] He was waived by the team on September 2, 2017 and was signed to their practice squad the next day.[10][11] He was promoted to the active roster on December 27, 2017.[12]

On September 1, 2018, Bundy was waived by the Giants.[13]

Arizona Hotshots

In 2019, Bundy joined the Arizona Hotshots of the Alliance of American Football.[14]

BC Lions

After the AAF ceased operations in April 2019, Bundy signed with the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League on May 20, 2019.


Personal life

He graduated with a liberal arts degree from University of New Mexico and his favorite athlete is Michael Jordan.[15]
