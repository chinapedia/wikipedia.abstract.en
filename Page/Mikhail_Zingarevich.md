The brothers had good prospects for a sporting career, but opted for education.

He received a degree in the machinery and mechanics of the pulp and paper industry.[14][15] He became an honorary professor of the Highest School of Technology and Energy at the St. Petersburg State University for Technology and Design (former Leningrad Technological Institute for the Pulp and Paper Industry) in 2008.[16]

From 1981 to 1991 he held various engineering positions at pulp and paper companies, including the Segezha pulp-and-paper plant and Izmail pulp-and-cardboard mill.[17][18]

In 1991, he became the Chief Sales Manager of Technoferm. In this role he established the cellulose and paper export sales processes.[19][20]

In 2009, he co-founded the Plaza Lotus Group development company. The main projects of this company to date have been the SINOP business centre at Sinopskaya embankment, the reconstruction of the historic building of the Stables Department and Emperor Pavel's military barracks, all of which are in St. Petersburg, Russia.

The first company's project, the SINOP business centre, has been put into operation and further sold to the Moscow's RBM Capital management company for 2 billion rubles in 2014.[32] The reconstruction of the historic building of the Stables Department was projected to host an apart-hotel in the building. The company signed an investment contract with St. Petersburg authorities in 2010 and got a construction permit in 2013. But historic preservation activists opposed the project. As a result of media attention being garnered by the activists, in early 2016, the city authorities proposed the investor, which had already invested 1.2 billion rubles, a few sites in St. Petersburg for construction of hotels.[33][34]


Ice hockey

In 2011, Mikhail Zingarevich with his twin-brother Boris founded the Nevsky Legion ice hockey team with Mikhail as a captain. The team became the champion of the IV Ice Hockey Amateur Teams Festival in Russia, which was held in a city of Sochi in 2015.[35]
