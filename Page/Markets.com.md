History

Markets.com began as GFC Markets and rebranded in 2010 as 'Markets.com' – this was done after a merger of GFC Markets' owner Safecap Investments Limited and TradeFX, a developer of software solutions for Forex and CFD operators. In 2015, Playtech fully acquired TradeFX and thus Markets.com for the sum of €458m.

Partnership with Arsenal FC

In 2014, Markets.com entered into a partnership with Arsenal FC as the football club's "official forex and CFD trading partner".[5]

The partnership with Arsenal FC was made in partly order to access the club's extensive digital channels.

As part of the partnership, Markets.com has provided 'Matchday Experiences' for competition winners. In 2015, an online advertisement was created to promote the partnership starring Mesut Özil and Olivier Giroud.[6]

Employee re-structuring

In the early months on 2016, Markets Ltd as part of its strategy of shifting towards automated sales and retention channels, restructured its operations and laid off a large number of its workforce, including the vast majority of its sales and retention divisions.[7] In the same year, Markets Ltd also decided to sell TopOption, the binary option brand of the company.[8]
