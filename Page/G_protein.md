G PROTEINS, also known as GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEINS, are a family of proteins that act as molecular switches inside cells, and are involved in transmitting signals from a variety of stimuli outside a cell to its interior. Their activity is regulated by factors that control their ability to bind to and hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). When they are bound to GTP, they are 'on', and, when they are bound to GDP, they are 'off'. G proteins belong to the larger group of enzymes called GTPases.

There are two classes of G proteins. The first function as monomeric small GTPases (small G-proteins), while the second function as heterotrimeric G protein complexes. The latter class of complexes is made up of _alpha_ (α), _beta_ (β) and _gamma_ (γ) subunits.[1] In addition, the beta and gamma subunits can form a stable dimeric complex referred to as the beta-gamma complex .[2]

Heterotrimeric G proteins located within the cell are activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that span the cell membrane.[3] Signaling molecules bind to a domain of the GPCR located outside the cell, and an intracellular GPCR domain then in turn activates a particular G protein. Some active-state GPCRs have also been shown to be "pre-coupled" with G proteins.[4] The G protein activates a cascade of further signaling events that finally results in a change in cell function. G protein-coupled receptor and G proteins working together transmit signals from many hormones, neurotransmitters, and other signaling factors.[5] G proteins regulate metabolic enzymes, ion channels, transporter proteins, and other parts of the cell machinery, controlling transcription, motility, contractility, and secretion, which in turn regulate diverse systemic functions such as embryonic development, learning and memory, and homeostasis.[6]


History

G proteins were discovered when Alfred G. Gilman and Martin Rodbell investigated stimulation of cells by adrenaline. They found that when adrenaline binds to a receptor, the receptor does not stimulate enzymes (inside the cell) directly. Instead, the receptor stimulates a G protein, which then stimulates an enzyme. An example is adenylate cyclase, which produces the second messenger cyclic AMP.[7] For this discovery, they won the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.[8]

Nobel prizes have been awarded for many aspects of signaling by G proteins and GPCRs. These include receptor antagonists, neurotransmitters, neurotransmitter reuptake, G protein-coupled receptors, G proteins, second messengers, the enzymes that trigger protein phosphorylation in response to cAMP, and consequent metabolic processes such as glycogenolysis.

Prominent examples include (in chronological order of awarding):

-   The 1947 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Carl Cori, Gerty Cori and Bernardo Houssay, for their discovery of how glycogen is broken down to glucose and resynthesized in the body, for use as a store and source of energy.

Function

G proteins are important signal transducing molecules in cells. "Malfunction of GPCR [G Protein-Coupled Receptor] signaling pathways are involved in many diseases, such as diabetes, blindness, allergies, depression, cardiovascular defects, and certain forms of cancer. It is estimated that about 30% of the modern drugs' cellular targets are GPCRs." [14] The human genome encodes roughly 800 [15] G protein-coupled receptors, which detect photons of light, hormones, growth factors, drugs, and other endogenous ligands. Approximately 150 of the GPCRs found in the human genome have still-unknown functions.

Whereas G proteins are activated by G protein-coupled receptors, they are inactivated by RGS proteins (for "Regulator of G protein signalling"). Receptors stimulate GTP binding (turning the G protein on). RGS proteins stimulate GTP hydrolysis (creating GDP, thus turning the G protein off).


Diversity

Human_Ga_protein_phylogeny.png All eukaryotes use G proteins for signaling and has evolved a large diversity of G proteins. For instance, humans encode 18 different G_(α) proteins, 5 G_(β) proteins, and 12 G_(γ) proteins.[16]


Signaling

G protein can refer to two distinct families of proteins. Heterotrimeric G proteins, sometimes referred to as the "large" G proteins, are activated by G protein-coupled receptors and are made up of alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) subunits. _"Small" G proteins_ (20-25kDa) belong to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. These proteins are homologous to the alpha (α) subunit found in heterotrimers, but are in fact monomeric, consisting of only a single unit. However, like their larger relatives, they also bind GTP and GDP and are involved in signal transduction.

Heterotrimeric

Different types of heterotrimeric G proteins share a common mechanism. They are activated in response to a conformational change in the GPCR, exchanging GDP for GTP, and dissociating in order to activate other proteins in a particular signal transduction pathway. The specific mechanisms, however, differ between protein types.

Common mechanism

GPCR-Zyklus.png Receptor-activated G proteins are bound to the inner surface of the cell membrane. They consist of the G_(α) and the tightly associated G_(βγ) subunits. There are many classes of G_(α) subunits: G_(s)α (G stimulatory), G_(i)α (G inhibitory), G_(o)α (G other), G_(q/11)α, and G_(12/13)α are some examples. They behave differently in the recognition of the effector molecule, but share a similar mechanism of activation.

Activation

When a ligand activates the G protein-coupled receptor, it induces a conformational change in the receptor that allows the receptor to function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that exchanges GDP for GTP – thus turning the GPCR "on". The GTP (or GDP) is bound to the G_(α) subunit in the traditional view of heterotrimeric GPCR activation. This exchange triggers the dissociation of the G_(α) subunit (which is bound to GTP) from the G_(βγ) dimer and the receptor as a whole. However, models which suggest molecular rearrangement, reorganization, and pre-complexing of effector molecules are beginning to be accepted.[17][18][19] Both G_(α)-GTP and G_(βγ) can then activate different _signaling cascades_ (or _second messenger pathways_) and effector proteins, while the receptor is able to activate the next G protein.[20]

Termination

The G_(α) subunit will eventually hydrolyze the attached GTP to GDP by its inherent enzymatic activity, allowing it to re-associate with G_(βγ) and starting a new cycle. A group of proteins called Regulator of G protein signalling (RGSs), act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), are specific for G_(α) subunits. These proteins accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, thus terminating the transduced signal. In some cases, the effector _itself_ may possess intrinsic GAP activity, which then can help deactivate the pathway. This is true in the case of phospholipase C-beta, which possesses GAP activity within its C-terminal region. This is an alternate form of regulation for the G_(α) subunit. Such G_(α) GAPs do not have catalytic residues (specific amino acid sequences) to activate the G_(α) protein. They work instead by lowering the required activation energy for the reaction to take place.[21]

Specific mechanisms

G_(αs)

G_(ΑS) activates the cAMP-dependent pathway by stimulating the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP. This is accomplished by direct stimulation of the membrane-associated enzyme adenylate cyclase. cAMP can then act as a second messenger that goes on to interact with and activate protein kinase A (PKA). PKA can phosphorylate a myriad downstream targets.

The cAMP-dependent pathway is used as a signal transduction pathway for many hormones including:

-   ADH – Promotes water retention by the kidneys (created by the V2 cells of the posterior pituitary)
-   GHRH – Stimulates the synthesis and release of GH (somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary)
-   GHIH – Inhibits the synthesis and release of GH (somatotroph cells of anterior pituitary)
-   CRH – Stimulates the synthesis and release of ACTH (anterior pituitary)
-   ACTH – Stimulates the synthesis and release of cortisol (zona fasiculata of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal glands)
-   TSH – Stimulates the synthesis and release of a majority of T4 (thyroid gland)
-   LH – Stimulates follicular maturation and ovulation in women; or testosterone production and spermatogenesis in men
-   FSH – Stimulates follicular development in women; or spermatogenesis in men
-   PTH – Increases blood calcium levels. This is accomplished via the Parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1) in the kidneys and bones, or via the Parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (PTH2) in the central nervous system and brain, as well as the bones and kidneys.
-   Calcitonin – Decreases blood calcium levels (via the calcitonin receptor in the intestines, bones, kidneys, and brain)
-   Glucagon – Stimulates glycogen breakdown in the liver
-   hCG – Promotes cellular differentiation, and is potentially involved in apoptosis.[22]
-   Epinephrine – released by the _adrenal medulla_ during the fasting state, when body is under metabolic duress. It stimulates glycogenolysis, in addition to the actions of glucagon.

G_(αi)

G_(ΑI) inhibits the production of cAMP from ATP. eg. somatostatin,prostaglandins

G_(αq/11)

G_(ΑQ/11) stimulates the membrane-bound phospholipase C beta, which then cleaves PIP₂ (a minor membrane phosphoinositol) into two second messengers, IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). The Inositol Phospholipid Dependent Pathway is used as a signal transduction pathway for many hormones including:

-   ADH (Vasopressin/AVP) – Induces the synthesis and release of glucocorticoids (Zona fasciculata of adrenal cortex in kidney); Induces vasoconstriction (V1 Cells of Posterior pituitary)
-   TRH – Induces the synthesis and release of TSH (Anterior pituitary)
-   TSH – Induces the synthesis and release of a small amount of T4 (Thyroid Gland)
-   Angiotensin II – Induces Aldosterone synthesis and release (zona glomerulosa of adrenal cortex in kidney)
-   GnRH – Induces the synthesis and release of FSH and LH (Anterior Pituitary)

G_(α12/13)

-   G_(Α12/13) are involved in Rho family GTPase signaling (see Rho family of GTPases). This is through the RhoGEF superfamily involving the RhoGEF domain of the proteins' structures). These are involved in control of cell cytoskeleton remodeling, and thus in regulating cell migration.

G_(β)

-   The G_(ΒΓ) complexes sometimes also have active functions. Examples include coupling to and activating G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels.

Small GTPases

Small GTPases, also known as small G-proteins, bind GTP and GDP likewise, and are involved in signal transduction. These proteins are homologous to the alpha (α) subunit found in heterotrimers, but exist as monomers. They are small (20-kDa to 25-kDa) proteins that bind to guanosine triphosphate (GTP). This family of proteins is homologous to the Ras GTPases and is also called the Ras superfamily GTPases.


Lipidation

In order to associate with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, many G proteins and small GTPases are lipidated, that is, covalently modified with lipid extensions. They may be myristolated, palmitoylated or prenylated.
