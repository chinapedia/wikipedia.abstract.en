Sri Lankan Tamil students V. SULAKSHAN AND N. GAJAN were shot dead by police in Kokkuvil in northern Sri Lanka on the night of 20 October 2016.[1][2]


Background

Vijayakumar Sulakshan was 24 years old and from Kandarodai.[3][4] Nadarajah Gajan was 23 years old and from Iranaimadu.[5][6][7] Both men were third year students at the University of Jaffna's Faculty of Arts and were studying political science and journalism.[8][9][10]


Incident

On the night of 20 October 2016 Gajan attended a social event at Sulakshan's house in Jaffna.[11] After the event Sulakshan was returning Gajan to his student hostel in Chunnakam on a motorcycle when, at around 11.30pm, the pair were shot by police at Kulapiddy junction on the Jaffna-KKS Road in Kokkuvil.[12][13] According to the police the students had failed to stop at a police roadblock at the junction and sped off.[14][15] The police opened fire, hitting the rider, Sulakshan, twice in the head and killing him.[16][17] The motorcycle rammed into a parapet wall on the roadside which resulted in serious injuries to the passenger, Gajan.[18] The police claimed that the students were under the influence of alcohol.[19][20][21]

Sulakshan and Gajan were rushed to Jaffna Teaching Hospital where Sulakshan was pronounced dead whilst Gajan succumbed to his injuries shortly afterwards.[22]


Aftermath

A tense situation prevailed in the area after the incident as other students surrounded the hospital's mortuary.[23] Nationally however news of the shooting was suppressed by the police and it was not until the following night (21) that the event was reported in Sri Lanka's national media.[24][25] The police initially denied that there was a shooting, claiming that the two deaths were accidental.[26][27][28] This led to accusations of a police cover-up.[29][30][31][32]

On the morning of 21 October 2016 Jaffna Magistrate S. Satheeshkaran arrived at the scene of the shooting to begin a magisterial inquiry.[33] Post-mortems were carried out that afternoon and initial reports suggested that bullets were found in the victims' bodies.[34][35] Sulakshan was reported to have been shot three times and had injuries to his chest, neck and spine.[36] Gajan was reportedly shot at least once.[37] According to the official Judicial Medical Officer's report, Sulakshan was killed by a shot in the chest and Gajan died of head injuries sustained during the crash into the wall.[38][39] The students bodies were returned to their parents but they were ordered to bury them rather than cremate.[40]

After the post-mortem contradicted the police's earlier statement officers from the Criminal Investigation Department were sent to take over the investigation.[41][42] On 22 October 2016 five police personnel (a sub-inspector, a sergeant, two constables and a driver) were arrested and remanded until 4 November 2016.[43][44][45]

Expressing grief at the deaths, President of Sri Lanka Maithripala Sirisena ordered an impartial inquiry and compensation for the students' parents.[46][47] The shooting was condemned by the Tamil National Alliance, the largest political party representing Sri Lankan Tamils.[48][49][50]
