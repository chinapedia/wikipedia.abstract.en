_In Loco Parentis/School Life_

In Loco Parentis (name changed to School Life for US cinema release) is a feature documentary that had its world premiere in Competition at IDFA, the largest documentary film festival in the world, and then had its North American premiere in the World Cinema Documentary competition at Sundance in January 2017. The film, shot observationally (or 'fly-on-the-wall' style) explores a year in the life of Headfort School, the last remaining boarding school for primary age (7 to 13) children in Ireland. This charming, humorous and award-winning documentary focuses on John and Amanda Leyden, who throughout their long careers at Headfort school have become legends in their own right. This warm and affectionate portrait places childhood center stage and celebrates the joy and power of teaching. The film was acquired after Sundance by Magnolia Pictures. It has screened at many international festivals and won awards at San Francisco International Film Festival (Special Jury Prize) and Visions du Réel (Prix du Public / Audience Award).[3]

_Fairytale of Kathmandu_

'Fairytale of Kathmandu' has been much acclaimed, and won several awards, including Documenta Madrid, Ourense and the Barcelona International Gay and Lesbian Festival.[4] _Fairytale of Kathmandu_ questioned whether poet Cathal Ó Searcaigh's sexual relationships with young Nepalese boys in Kathmandu were proper or improper. The boys were aged between 16 and 18 at the time of filming, and Ó Searcaigh was over 50. According to Variety, the film raised questions about "power, money and what constitutes coercion".[5] The Irish Examiner newspaper said that Ní Chianáin as a 'whistleblower' paid a high price for questioning Ó Searcaigh's behaviour in Kathamandu.[6]

_The Stranger_

_The Stranger_ explores the story of Neal MacGregor. He was an Englishman who in the 1960s had studied cabinetry, jewelry and silver design in London, and had worked for the interior designer Anthony Redmile, and had married. Then, without explanation, he relocated on his own to Inishbofin, a tiny island off the extreme north-west coast of County Donegal. (One person who knew MacGregor in the 1960s has suggested that MacGregor had had a bad acid trip during one of the Isle of Wight Festivals.) On Inishbofin, he lived in an abandoned stone hen house, too small to stand up in, without water, gas or electricity. While there, he made things with his hands: such as a grandfather clock, a windmill, and his own fishing nets and hooks. He wrote diaries. He and a local woman, Mary, formed a relationship. They grew their own vegetables, and stayed on the island during the winter, a season during which other locals returned to the mainland. There were rumours that he was a spy, or perhaps something worse. He died suddenly in 1990, from a heart attack, at the age of 43 or 44.[7][8][9][10][11]
