History

In Touch Networks launched its first network, NonExecutiveDirectors.com, in 2013[3]. This network was developed to give professionals the skills necessary to successfully make the transition into a non-executive career and allow companies to hire these candidates without heavy recruitment fees.

The company runs networking events, provides executive coaching, has an in-house CV writing service, and provides corporate board analyses[4].

Having established NonExecutiveDirectors.com as the UK's largest non-executive director network[5], the company expanded into other sectors, launching four additional networks within 3 years – TheConsultantHub.com, FinanceDirectorNetwork.com, WomenDirectors.com and finally InvestorDirector.com[6]. In 2016, The company also founded a charity, In Touch Futures[7].

In Touch Networks was also named by Financial Times as one of the top 100 fast growing UK companies that are also making an impact on their industry and wider society[8].

In December 2018, the company decided to merge all individual networks into one unified network branded In Touch. This was to allow members the flexibility to access more opportunities across sectors. At the same time, the company moved to a new HQ in central Manchester. They have created a bespoke event space that has also allowed them to move into the event management business[9]. To combat extremely high turnover of staff, In Touch also dedicated time and resources into recruitment, opening their In Touch Careers channel. [10]
