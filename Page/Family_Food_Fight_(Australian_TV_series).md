_FAMILY FOOD FIGHT_ (abbreviated as _FFF_) is an Australian reality competition television series series that aired on the Nine Network from 30 October 2017 until 11 December 2018.[1] The series saw diverse and multi-generational Australian families go head-to-head in high-pressure cooking challenges inspired by real home cooking and family food traditions to win an ultimate prize of $100,000.[2][3]

Although the first season of the series had disappointing ratings,[4] a desire to sell the show internationally led it to be renewed for a second season, which premiered on 29 October 2018.[5] Despite a number of international adaptations in development, the show has continued to struggle to find an audience locally.[6]


Production

The series was announced at Network Nine's upfronts in November 2016.[7] Auditions opened in February 2017, searching for family teams of four people with all members required to be amateur cooks; auditions closed on 13 April 2017.[8] In July 2017, Matt Moran, Hayden Quinn and Anna Polyviou were announced as judges of the series with Tom Parker Bowles to appear as a guest judge.[9][10] In episode 15 it was announced that Parker Bowles would remain with the show for the finals, and so he appeared in all episodes.

Season 2 saw the teams reduced from four contestants to two. Hayden Quinn opted not to return as a judge for the second season.[11]

_Family Food Fight_ is filmed at the Melbourne Showgrounds.
