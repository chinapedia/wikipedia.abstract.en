PRABANDHA is a literary genre of medieval Indian Sanskrit literature. The _prabandha_s contain semi-historical anecdotes about the lives of famous persons. They were written primarily by Jain scholars of western India (Gujarat and Malwa) from 13th century onwards. The _prabandha_s feature colloquial Sanskrit with vernacular expressions, and contain elements of folklore.


Definition

The _prabandha_s are semi-historical anecdotes about famous persons. The _Prabandha Kosha_ of Rajashekhara Suri mentions two types of biographical narratives: _charita_s and _prabandha_s. It states that the _charita_s are the life-stories of tirthankaras, kings and religious leaders up to Aryarakshita-Suri (who died in 30 CE). The biographies of persons born after Aryarakshita-Suri are called _prabandha_s. It is not clear if this is Rajashekhara's own definition or if it is based on some other authority. However, several later texts do not abide by this definition. For example, there are texts titled _Kumarapala-Charita_, _Vastupala-Charita_ and _Jagadu-Charita_ about people who flourished after the end of the 1st millennium CE.

Prabandhas were written primarily by Jain scholars from 13th century onwards. The authors were based in western India, and wrote primarily in colloquial Sanskrit (as opposed to Classical Sanskrit). The _prabandha_s make heavy use vernacular (that is, non-Sanskrit) expressions, and often appear close to the folk tradition.


Example texts

_Trishashti-Shalaka-Purusha-Charitra_ by the 12th century Jain scholar Hemachandra contains legendary narratives about 63 persons. However, the earliest collection explicitly titled _Prabandha-_ is Jinabhadra's _Prabandhavali_ (1234 CE).

Some of the notable _Prabandha_ collections include:

_Prabandhavali_ by Jinabhadra, 1234 CE
    It contains 40 _prabandha_s about historic personalities (most of them from western India), including _Prithviraja Prabandha_. It was composed at the request of Vastupala's son Jaitrasimha.
    It is not available in complete form, but:
    -   Some of its contents have been included in Jinavijaya's 20th century collection _Puratana Prabandha Samgraha_
    -   _Valabhi-Bhanga_ _prabandha_ in Merutunga's _Prabandha-Chintamani_ is also copied from _Prabandhavali_.
    -   The _Padaliptacharya Prabandha_ and _Ratna-Shravaka-Prabandha_ in Rajashekhara's _Prabandha-Kosha_ are taken from _Prabandhavali_

_Prabhavaka Charita_ by Prabhachandra, 1277 CE
    It covers 22 Shvetambara Jain monks from Vajrasvamin to Hemachandra, as a continuation of Hemachandra's _Parishishtaparvan_ (or _Sthaviravali-Charita_). It also includes anecdotes about historical kings and poets.

_Laghu-Prabandha-Sangraha_ by anonymous, 13th century
    It was compiled by a Gujarat-based poet between 1243 CE and 1409 CE. It contains 10 small _prabandha_s.

_Prabandha-Chintamani_ of Merutunga, 1305 CE
    It contains 135 _prabandha_s categorized under 11 topics and 5 _prakasha_s (sections). It is an important source of history of early medieval Gujarat.

_Vividha-Tirtha-Kalpa_ or _Kalpa-Pradipa_ by Jinaprabha, 1333 CE
    44 of its 63 chapters describes the Jain pilgrimage centres, but it also includes 7 _kalpa_s or chapters covering biographies (that is, _prabandha_s).

_Nabhi-nandana-jinoddhara-prabandha_ by Kakkasūri of the Upakeśa Gaccha, 1336 CE.
    Records the renovation of the Rishabhanatha Jain temple in Shatrunjaya, and provides a history of the author's spiritual lineage (Upakesha-gaccha)

_Prabandha Kosha_ of Rajashekhara Suri, 1349 CE
    Also known as _Chaturvinshati Prabandha_, it contains 24 _prabandha_s. The personalities covered include 10 Suris (Jain teachers), 7 kings, 4 poets, and 3 Jain laymen.

_Puratana-Prabandha-Samgraha_ by multiple writers, before 15th century
    Also known as _Prabandha-Chintamani-Samvada-Puratana-Sangraha_, it contains 63 _prabandha_s, some borrowed from the earlier _prabandha_ collections. In 20th century, Muni Jinavijaya found its manuscript (titled _Prabandha-Sangraha_) at Patan, and published it under the name _Puratana-Prabandha-Sangraha_.

_Kumarapala-Prabandha_ by Jinamandana, 1435 CE
    Contains 9 _prabandha_s about Kumarapala, and also provides information about his predecessors and ancestors.

_Bhoja-Prabandha_ by Ballala (or Vallalasena), 16th century
    This is a collection of stories about king Bhoja, which are historically unreliable, but provide entertainment value. It anachronistically places non-contemporary poets such as Kalidasa, Bana, Mayura, Bhavabhuti and Magha as Bhoja's contemporaries.
    Verses of other poets such as Kalidasa, Subandhu and Magha appear in this collection. It also includes some content from _Panchatantra_.
    It is not to be confused with 5 other works titled _Bhoja-Prabandha_ (by Merutunga, Rajavallabha, Vatsaraja, Shubhashila and Padmagupta).

_Panchashati-Prabandha-Sambandha_ by Shubhashila Gani, 1464 CE
    Contains 625 _prabandha_s, which are brief accounts of Jain monks and laymen
