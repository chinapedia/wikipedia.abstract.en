JĀMEH MOSQUE OF ZAVAREH ( – _Masjed-e-Jāme-e Zavareh_) CONGRETATION MOSQUE OF ZAVAREH, FRIDAY MOSQUE OF ZAVAREH or GRAND MOSQUE OF ZAVAREH is the grand, congregational mosque (Jāmeh) of Zavareh city, within the Isfahan Province of Iran.

An inscription in the entrance stucco dates this Seljuk-era mosque to 1135-1136, making it the first known dated mosque constructed according to a four-portico (iwan) plan in the post-Islamic Iran.

Centrally located in the pre-Islamic city of Zavareh, this mosque is the earliest dated example of a four-iwan plan scheme. Contrary to most Seljuk mosques, the inscription containing the date and the patronage for the building is located on the courtyard façade. Although this information is not completely preserved, a date of 1135 (530 A.H.) can be established for this building. The patron of the mosque is identified as Abu Taher Hosein bin Ghali bin Ahmad. In another inscription on the eastern side of the south iwan, the date of the mihrab is recorded as 1156 (551 A.H.).[1]
