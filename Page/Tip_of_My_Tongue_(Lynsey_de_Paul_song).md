"TIP OF MY TONGUE" is a song written by Lynsey de Paul and Barry Blue (originally registered as "On the Tip of My Tongue").[1] It was first released as the fifth single by Brotherly Love (a Liverpool-based group composed of three brothers, Mike, Ronnie and Lee Carroll, who are brothers of impressionist Faith Brown)[2] with the song "I Love Everything About You" as the flip side on CBS Records in 1973 and was produced by Phil Wainman.[3][4] The group performed the song on the Granada TV programme _Lift Off With Ayshea_ on 22 June 1973.[5] The song received positive reviews from the British music press,[6] and the brothers were interviewed about the single[7] but it did not reach the UK Singles Chart.[8] Barry Blue was credited as "Barry Green" on this release.[9][10]

The female soul trio Ellie (aka the Hope Sisters - Ellie, Christine and Kathy) released their version of "Tip of My Tongue" produced by Barry Blue as a single (backed by "Someone's Stolen My Marbles") on the Fresh Air record label in the UK, on London Records in North America and on the Phillips label in Germany, France and Australia in 1974.[11][12][13] They performed the song on the German TV music program, _Hits a Go Go_, on 22 October 1974.[14] The song was also included on the German 1975 compilation album _Various â€“ 26 Original Top Hits_.[15] It was also chosen as record of the week by Dutch DJ Frans van der Drift at Radio Mi Amigo on 29 December 1974.[16] Ellie Hope went on to form Liquid Gold where she was the lead singer. The song's co-writer, Barry Blue, released his own recording of the song as an album track in 1974,[17][18] and this version was later on the compilation album _The Very Best of Barry Blue_ released in 2003.

In 1977, the Canadian band, Great Rufus Road Machine, a pop band from Kitchener, Ontario, recorded the song and released it as a single, with "Can't You Do It Now" as the B-side of the single.[19][20] It was also included as the lead track on their self-named album.[21][22]

The British band The Dooleys also recorded their version of the song as a track on their 1981 album, _Secrets_, which was suggested by the album's producer Barry Blue.[23] The album was renamed _The Dancer_ for its release in Japan and made number 41 on the Japanese Albums Chart.[24] The Dooleys version of the song was finally released on CD in 2013 on the _Full House / Secrets_ double album.[25][26]
