Dareen_Tatour.jpg DAREEN TATOUR (born 16 April 1982 in Reineh) is a Palestinian poet, photographer, and social media activist from Reineh, Israel, who writes in Arabic, her mother tongue.[1] Following the publication of a poem on social media, she was tried and convicted in 2018 in an Israeli court for "inciting violence" and "supporting a terrorist organisation",[2][3][4] being released in September, 2018.[5] In May 2019, her conviction for the poem was overturned but her conviction for other social media posts was upheld.

She has published her work on Facebook, and YouTube.[6]


Social media posts and arrest

In October 2015, Tatour published a poem on YouTube and Facebook titled "Qawem Ya Shaabi Qawemahum" ("Resist my people, resist them"),[7] where the words were cited as the soundtrack to images of Palestinians in violent confrontations with Israeli troops.[8] This led to her arrest and indictment for incitement to violence and for support of a terrorist organization. A full translation of the poem as made by a police officer is cited in the indictment document. The rest of the indictment relates to three Facebook publications: (i) the picture of Israa Abed, a women from Nazareth, laid on the ground of the central bus station in Afula after she was shot by Israeli soldiers and guards; (ii) a profile picture with the Arabic writing "Ana Al-Shahid Al-Jay" ("I am the next martyr"); and (iii) a post citing the call by Islamic Jihad for Intifada in the West Bank and calling for Intifada inside the green line for the Al-Aqsa Mosque.[9]

Reactions

According to the BBC, "the poet's case has become a cause celebre for free speech advocates and has drawn attention to a recent rise in Israeli arrests - of Israeli Arabs and Palestinians in the occupied West Bank - accused of incitement or planning attacks online"[10] The PEN American Center condemned her arrest and sentencing in 2016,[11][12] organized letter-writing campaigns on her behalf,[13] and following her conviction in May 2018 stated that the conviction “relies on a wanton mischaracterization of her work and is an unacceptable attack on freedom of expression in Israel”.[14] Her arrest was condemned by Jewish Voice for Peace.


Trial, sentence and successful appeal

She was convicted on May 3, 2018,[15] and on 31 July 2018 sentenced to five months' imprisonment.[16] She was released in September, 2018.[17]

In May 2019, the Nazareth District Court overturned her conviction for the poem, though not the convictions for other social media posts.[18] The court ruled that the poem did not "involve unequivocal remarks that would provide the basis for a direct call to carry out acts".[19] The court noted that Tatour was known as a poet and that "freedom of expression is accorded added weight when it also involves freedom of artistic and creative [expression]".[20]
