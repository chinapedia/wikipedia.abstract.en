MARGARITA RIVIÈRE MARTÍ (17 August 1944 – 29 March 2015) was a Spanish journalist and writer, the author of thousands of newspaper articles and interviews and 30 books. She was noted for her progressive and feminist spirit in the years of the Transition.[1] She was one of the first women to practice journalism in Spain, and she and Teresa Rubio were the first two female journalists for the _Diario de Barcelona_. In 1978 she was one of the founders of _El Periódico de Catalunya_.[2]


Biography

Rivière studied journalism at the Escuela de la Iglesia de Barcelona, and philosophy at the Universidad de la Ciudad Condal, in addition to design in Paris.[3]

Her first journalistic jobs were in the fashion world, as a Spanish correspondent for the French magazine _Marie Claire_, where she worked from 1965 to 1968.[4] She next worked for the journal of economic monographs _Dossier Mundo_, from 1971 to 1974, of which she was editor-in-chief. After this she was head of the Culture section of _Diario de Barcelona_ beginning in 1978, and head of the same section of _El Periódico de Catalunya_ beginning in 1984. There she also directed the Sunday edition, and daily opinion columns.

From 1988 to 1992 she was the director of the news agency EFE in Catalonia.[5]

In some of her interviews Rivière recalled how there were no women's bathrooms on newspaper premises, requiring her to travel quite far to find one.[6]

Her first book, co-written with gynecologist Santiago Dexeus in 1977, was the first manual on contraception to be published in Spain. At that time, Article 416 of the old penal code prohibited publicizing contraceptives, even though it was not prohibited to sell or consume them.[7]

Throughout her career she focused her efforts on interviews and articles, especially in Catalonia. Her interviewees included King Juan Carlos I, El Lute, Yoko Ono, the Dalai Lama, Pedro Almodóvar, Edgar Morin, Jordi Pujol, Elia Kazan, John Kenneth Galbraith, La Pasionaria, and Julio Iglesias. Her articles were published in _El País_, _El Periódico_, and _La Vanguardia_. From 1981 to 1984 she had daily interview feature in _El Periódico_.[8]

She also created the magazine _Qué leer_, directed television programs, and wrote speeches and scripts, including for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

She edited the essay collection _El círculo cuadrado_ for the publishing house Plaza & Janés.[9][10][11]

Her last book to be published, _Clave K_, was a satire on power relations in Catalonia. It had been written 15 years earlier. Due to illness, she could not attend the presentation of the book in person and sent an audiovisual message.

Rivière died on 29 March 2015, at age 70, from a lung disease.[12]
