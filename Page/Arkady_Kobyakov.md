"'Arkady Kobyakov O."' (2 June 1976, Nizhny Novgorod — 19 September 2015, Podolsk) is a Russian singer.


Childhood and youth

Kabyakov Arkady Olegovich was born on 2 June 1976 in the city of Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod) in the family of ordinary workers. Father, Kobyakov Oleg Glebovich, worked as a chief mechanic of a motor depot, the mother, Volkova Tatyana Yurievna — the toy factory. In the family, Arkady was an only child. At an early age a kindergarten teacher advised the parents to determine Arkady in music school. So, at the age of 6 at the insistence of the grandmother, he enrolled in the Nizhny Novgorod choral chapel of boys (now Nizhny Novgorod choral College. L. K. Sivukhina), where he learned the rudiments of music on piano.

The grandmother played an important role in the education of Arkady — she instilled in him a love for music, learned to accept life for what it is, and treat everything philosophically.

When Arkady was still a child, his mother left the family, leaving him with his father, and in the future showed no interest in the fate of Arkady.

His musical education Arkady to finish was not to be. Because of his fervor and rowdy character in the 14 years he was sentenced to 3.5 years and sent to serve his sentence in Ardatovskiy educational-labor colony for minors in Nizhny Novgorod region.

Shortly before its release, in December 1993, under ridiculous circumstances, his father dies. This tragic event left a deep trace in his soul and, experiencing a sense of loss of his father, he increasingly manifests hostility to his mother, who had gone to another man.
