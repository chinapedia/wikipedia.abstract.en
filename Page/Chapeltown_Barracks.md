CHAPELTOWN BARRACKS was a military installation in Chapeltown, Leeds, England, situated on the north and south sides of Barrack Road.[1]


History

The barracks were constructed by Craven and Co. in 1820.[2] They were largely used by cavalry regiments until the 1880s by which time they were in a poor state of repair.[3] It was from about that time that the cavalry school was used by elements of the Leeds Rifles, a Volunteer Force regiment.[4] The Leeds Rifles moved to the Army Reserve Centre at Harewood Barracks in 1967 and the barracks were largely demolished in 1988.[5]
