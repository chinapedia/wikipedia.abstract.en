JEAN-PIERRE MASSON (August 25, 1918 - March 11, 1995) was a Canadian film and television actor, best known for his long-running television role as Séraphin Poudrier in _Les Belles Histoires des pays d'en haut_.[1]

Masson studied law at the Université de Montréal, where he was a classmate of Pierre Trudeau, and acted with the Compagnons de Saint-Laurent theatre troupe. Following his graduation, he pursued acting as a career instead of law, taking both stage and radio roles until being cast as Leonidas Plouffe in the television series _The Plouffe Family_ in 1953[2] and as Mr. Jeneau in _14, rue de Galais_ in 1954. In 1956, he was cast in _Les Belles Histoires_, a series which lasted until 1970.

Following _Les Belles Histoires_, Masson had other supporting roles, including the films _Cordélia_, _A Scream from Silence (Mourir à tue-tête)_, _Bound for Glory (Partis pour la gloire)_, _Why Rock the Boat?_, _Maria Chapdelaine_ and _The Alley Cat (Le Matou)_, and the television series _Terre humaine_ and _He Shoots, He Scores_. However, he was too strongly typecast by his longtime role as Séraphin Poudrier, and never had another major leading role.[3]

Masson died in a motel room in Pottsville, Pennsylvania on March 11, 1995, while travelling to Florida.[4]
