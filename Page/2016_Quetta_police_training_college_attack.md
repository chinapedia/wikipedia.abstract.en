On 24 October 2016, three heavily armed terrorists carried out an attack on the Balochistan police training college in Quetta, Pakistan, killing 61 cadets and injuring more than 165 others.[1][2][3] The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province claimed responsibility for the attack,[4] and Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed to have collaborated with them.[5] According to Pakistani authorities, the assailants came from Afghanistan and were in contact with their handlers there while perpetrating the attack.[6]


Attack

Three militants entered the training centre around 11:10 pm on Tuesday 24 October,[7][8] while cadets were sleeping, and opened fire before taking hundreds of police cadets hostage and engaging in a standoff with security forces. At least 61 people were killed and over 165 people were injured as well.[9][10][11][12]

Three militants were killed during the attack. Two detonated suicide belts and the third was shot by police, with many of the victims being killed when the attackers detonated their belts.[13]


Perpetrators

Pakistan's national security advisor Naseer Khan Janjua stated to U.S. ambassador David Hale that India's Research and Analysis Wing and Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security (NDS) were "patronising" terrorist organisations on attacking soft targets in Pakistan, and emphasised the need for effective action against militant elements in Afghanistan linked to the attack.[14][15]

Maj. Gen. Sher Afgan, the chief of the Frontier Corps in Quetta, said that a faction of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a Pakistan-based sectarian Sunni group, was believed to have carried out the attack. Shortly afterwards, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL) claimed responsibility via its Amaq media wing. It also released the photos of the claimed attackers.[16][17][18] [19]

A senior security official said that the ISIL had "outsourced" the attack to Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.[20] A spokesman of the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi faction _Al-Alami_ subsequently told Reuters that the two groups (_Al-Alami_ and ISIL) had "done this attack together".[21] Analysts said that the ISIL clearly has a presence in Pakistan and has local groups working with it.[22]


Aftermath

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif cancelled all of his engagements and called a meeting with arms officials in Quetta.[23][24] Pakistan's national security advisor Naseer Khan Janjua stated to U.S. ambassador David Hale that India's Research and Analysis Wing and Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security (NDS) were "patronising" terrorist organisations on attacking soft targets in Pakistan, and emphasised the need for effective action against militant elements in Afghanistan linked to the attack.[25][26]

Chief Minister Sanaullah Zehri revealed on November 10, 2016 the arrest of mastermind and facilitator of the attack.[27]
