He was the son of Dadusha and nephew of Naram-Suen of Eshnunna.

He conquered the cities of Diniktum and Rapiqum.[2] With Ḫammu-rāpi of Babylon, and the Amorite king Shamshi-Adad I he besieged the kingdom of Malgium until its ruler bought them off with 15 talents of silver.Third_Mari.png

He was a contemporary of Zimri-Lim of Mari, and formed powerful alliances with Yarim-Lim I[3] Amud-pi-el of Qatanum, Rim-Sin I of Larsa and most importantly Hammurabi of Babylon,[4] to appose the rise of Shamshi-Adad I in Assyria (on his northern border) who himself had alliances with Charchemish, Hassum and Urshu[5] and Qatna.

Some scholars have suggested the biblical king Amraphel[6] may have been Ibal Pi-El II of Esnunna.[7][8] While others[9][10] consider Ameraphel to be Hammurabi.

He was killed by Siwe-palar-huppak of Elam, who captured Eshnunna, and he was succeeded by Silli-Sin.
