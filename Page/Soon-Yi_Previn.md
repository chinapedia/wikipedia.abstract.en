SOON-YI PREVIN (; born 8 October 1970) is the adopted daughter of actress Mia Farrow and musician André Previn, and the wife of filmmaker Woody Allen. Previn is notable for her relationship with Allen, who was Mia Farrow's romantic partner before becoming involved with Previn. Previn's relationship with Allen became national news in 1992.


Early life and education

Soon-Yi Previn was born in South Korea. Previn's true age and date of birth are unknown, but are estimated based on a bone scan;[1] her passport indicates a date of birth of 8 October 1970.[2] Previn states that as a young child, she wandered the streets of Seoul starving and living out of trash cans.[3] She was eventually placed in an orphanage.[4][5] Prior to her adoption, U.S. federal law only allowed two visas per family for international adoption. Mia Farrow requested that her friends Rose and William Styron contact Massachusetts Congressman Michael Harrington to ask that he sponsor a bill to change this law. In 1977, the law was changed.[6] In 1978, following the change, Previn was adopted by Farrow and her then-husband, André Previn, and relocated to the United States;[7] at the time, she spoke no known language and reportedly battled learning disabilities.[8][9] Rose Styron is her godmother.[10]

In 1979, Mia Farrow ended her marriage to André Previn and began a long-term relationship with Woody Allen.[11] Allen later adopted two of Farrow's adopted children: Dylan Farrow (also known as Eliza) and Moses Farrow. Farrow also gave birth to Ronan Farrow in 1987.

Previn attended Marymount School of New York and Rider University. She graduated from Drew University[12][13] and earned a Master's Degree in Special Education from Columbia University.[14][15]

During her teens, Previn made an uncredited appearance in _Hannah and Her Sisters_ (1986), which starred Mia Farrow and was directed by Woody Allen. Previn appeared as an extra in Paul Mazurski's 1991 film entitled _Scenes from a Mall_,[16] which starred Allen. Previn also appeared alongside Allen in the documentary _Wild Man Blues_ (1997).[17]

In 1992, Previn stated that Mia Farrow had physically abused her.[18] Previn's brother, Moses Farrow, has stated that he, too, was physically abused by Mia Farrow.[19]


Relationship with Woody Allen

Following her injury, Previn began attending New York Knicks basketball games with Allen.[21]

In January 1992, Farrow found nude photographs of Previn in Allen's home. Allen, then 56, told Farrow that he had taken the photos the day before, approximately two weeks after he and Previn had first engaged in sexual intercourse.[22] Farrow contends that she broke off her relationship with Allen in 1992 following her discovery of the affair;[23][24] Previn and Allen dispute this assertion, claiming that Allen and Farrow were no longer dating at the time that Farrow discovered the nude photos of Previn.[25] Previn was a college student at the time her relationship with Allen began.[26][27] Allen described his relationship with Previn as a "fling" that developed into a more significant relationship.[28] Allen has called his role in their adult relationship 'paternal', while denying any parental or paternal role in Previn's life during her upbringing.[29][30][31][32] Allen issued a statement on 17 August 1992 saying that he was in love with Previn.[33]

Previn's relationship with Allen became public and "erupted into tabloid headlines and late-night monologues in August 1992."[34] As of 2006, Previn remained estranged from Farrow.[35]

Previn married Allen in Venice on 22 December 1997.[36][37] They have adopted two children together: Bechet Dumaine Allen and Manzie Tio Allen.[38][39] The family resides on Manhattan's Upper East Side.[40]
