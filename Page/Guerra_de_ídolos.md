Plot

Mateo Solar is the best composer and musical producer of the moment, both in the regional and urban genres. Member of a family of artists of Latin origin settled in Houston, he makes the "mistake" of falling in love with Manara; a singer whom they plan to release as a new pop star. But who brought Manara to him was Amado Matamoros, brother of Manara and Julia, trafficker of people and guns, who has controlled the lives of his sisters. Manara, unlike Julia, knows perfectly who is beloved, but keeps it secret to protect her sister, who is the light of his eyes and who has protected her since their mother died. The stormy relationship between Mateo and Manara goes against many interests, triggering ambitions and a war up and down the stages, which will extend from Los Angeles to Houston, and from Monterrey to Mexico City, exposing the most dark side of the world of music.

Mateo finds out that Matamoros had his brother and father killed, now the struggle starts when Mateo wants revenge for the death of his brother and father, while trying to protect Manara the love of his life.
