SHANMUGASUNDARAM was an Indian film actor who has appeared in Tamil films. He began his career as an actor by starring in _Ratha Thilagam_ (1963) and _Karnan_ (1964), and continued his career for seven decades.[1] He died on 15 August 2017.[2][3]


Career

Shanmugasundaram was born in Chennai to a family of businesspeople. When he was studying in college, he had accompanied one of his actor friends to a drama performance, and as one of the junior artists did not perform well, he was brought in spontaneously. To the surprise of many, he had done that role with efficiency, which earned him appreciation spontaneously. He then moved on to work in Tamil theatre, notably appearing as Adolf Hitler in a play also featuring Kannadasan. Sivaji Ganesan was impressed by his performances and recruited him to make film acting debut with _Ratha Thilagam_ (1963), where he portrayed a Chinese army major. He next went on to play the mythological character of Salliya Chakravarthy in B. R. Panthulu's critically acclaimed _Karnan_ (1964),[4] a crippled man in K. S. Gopalakrishnan's _Vazhaiyadi Vazhai_ and a prince in _Dasavatharam_ (1976).[5]

Shanmugasundaramâ€™s role in the 1989 Tamil film, _Karagattakaran_ directed by Gangai Amaran, won him critical acclaim and prompted several film makers to offer him roles as a village chieftain and the scene where he pleads innocence to his sister (Gandhimathi) made him popular among mimicry artists. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, he moved on to feature in television serials, and collaborated with Raadhika in series such as _Annamalai_, _Selvi_ and its sequel, _Arasi_. In the 2010s, he has regularly featured in films directed by Gangai Amaran's son, Venkat Prabhu.


Death

Shanmugasundaram died on August 15, 2017 due to age related ailments.[6] Some of the websites lists his age as 77 or 79.[7]
