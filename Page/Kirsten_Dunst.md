Early life

Kirsten Caroline Dunst was born on April 30, 1982, in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, the daughter of Klaus Hermann Dunst and Inez Rupprecht. She has a younger brother named Christian.[1][2] Her father worked for Siemens as a medical services executive, and her mother worked for Lufthansa as a flight attendant.[3][4] She was also an artist and one-time gallery owner.[5] Dunst's father is German, originally from Hamburg, and her New Jersey-born mother is of German and Swedish descent.[6][7] Until the age of 11, Dunst lived in Brick Township, New Jersey, where she attended Ranney School.[8] Her parents separated in 1993, and she subsequently moved with her mother and brother to Los Angeles, where she attended Laurel Hall School in North Hollywood and Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks. Among her classmates was Rami Malek, who was a grade above; they were both in a musical theater class. In 1995, her mother filed for divorce.[9]

After graduating from high school in 2000, Dunst continued acting.[10] As a teenager, she found it difficult to deal with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child. However, she later said that her mother "always had the best intentions".[11] When asked if she had any regrets about her childhood, Dunst said, "Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew up and I wouldn't change it. I have my stuff to work out... I don't think anybody can sit around and say, 'My life is more screwed up than yours.' Everybody has their issues."[12]


Career

1988–1993: Early work

Dunst began her career when she was three years old as a child fashion model in television commercials.[13][14] She was signed with Ford Models and Elite Model Management.[15]

At the age of six, she made her feature film debut in a minor role in Woody Allen's short film _Oedipus Wrecks_; it was released as one-third of the anthology film _New York Stories_ (1989). Soon after, Dunst performed in the comedy-drama _The Bonfire of the Vanities_ (1990), based on Tom Wolfe's novel of the same name, in which she played the daughter of Tom Hanks's character.[16] In 1993, Dunst made a guest appearance in an episode of the science fiction drama _Star Trek: The Next Generation_.[17]

1994–2001: Breakthrough and critical success

Her breakthrough role came in 1994, in the horror drama _Interview with the Vampire_ opposite Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, based on Anne Rice's novel of the same name. She played Claudia, the child vampire who is a surrogate daughter to Cruise and Pitt's characters.[18] The film received mixed reviews,[19] but many critics praised Dunst's performance. Roger Ebert commented that Dunst's creation of the child vampire Claudia was one of the "creepier" aspects of the film, and mentioned her ability to convey the impression of great age inside apparent youth.[20] Todd McCarthy in _Variety_ said that Dunst was "just right" for the family.[21]

The film featured a scene in which Dunst shared her first on-screen kiss with Pitt, who was almost two decades older.[22] In an interview with _Interview_ magazine, she revealed that kissing him had made her feel uncomfortable: "I thought it was gross, that Brad had cooties. I mean, I was 10."[23] Her performance earned her the MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance, the Saturn Award for Best Young Actress, and her first Golden Globe Award nomination.[24][25][26]

Later in 1994, Dunst co-starred in the drama film _Little Women_ opposite Winona Ryder and Claire Danes.[27] The film received favorable reviews.[28] Critic Janet Maslin of _The New York Times_ wrote that the film was the greatest adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel of the same name and remarked on Dunst's performance,

  "The perfect contrast to take-charge Jo comes from Kirsten Dunst's scene-stealing Amy, whose vanity and twinkling mischief make so much more sense coming from an 11-year-old vixen than they did from grown-up Joan Bennett in 1933. Ms. Dunst, also scarily effective as the baby bloodsucker of _Interview With the Vampire_, is a little vamp with a big future."[29]

In 1995, Dunst co-starred in the fantasy adventure film _Jumanji_, loosely based on Chris Van Allsburg's 1981 children's book of the same name.[30] The story is about a supernatural and ominous board game in which animals and other jungle hazards appear with each roll of the dice.[31] She was part of an ensemble cast that included Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier. The movie grossed $262 million worldwide.[32] That year, and again in 2002, Dunst was named one of _People_ magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People.[33]

From 1996 to 1997, Dunst had a recurring role in season three of the NBC medical drama _ER_. She played Charlie Chemingo, a child prostitute who was being cared for by the ER pediatrician Dr. Doug Ross (George Clooney).[34] In 1997, she voiced Young Anastasia in the animated musical film _Anastasia_.[35] Also in 1997, Dunst appeared in the black comedy film _Wag the Dog_, opposite Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman.[36] The following year she voiced the title character, Kiki, a thirteen-year-old apprentice witch who leaves her home village to spend a year on her own, in the anime movie _Kiki's Delivery Service_ (1998).[37]

Dunst was offered the role of Angela in the 1999 drama film _American Beauty_, but turned it down because she did not want to appear in the film's suggestive sexual scenes or kiss the film's star Kevin Spacey. She later explained: "When I read it, I was 15 and I don't think I was mature enough to understand the script's material."[38] That same year, she co-starred in the comedy film _Dick_, opposite Michelle Williams. The film is a parody retelling the events of the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of U.S. president Richard Nixon.[39]

Dunst appeared in Savage Garden's music video "I Knew I Loved You", the first single from their second and final album _Affirmation_ (1999).[40]

Dunst co-starred opposite James Woods in Sofia Coppola's drama film _The Virgin Suicides_ (1999), based on Jeffrey Eugenides' novel of the same name. She played Lux Lisbon, one of the troubled teenage daughters of Ronald Lisbon (Woods).[41] The film was screened as a special presentation at the 43rd San Francisco International Film Festival in 2000.[42] The movie received generally favorable reviews.[43] _San Francisco Chronicle_ critic Peter Stack noted in his review that Dunst "beautifully balances innocence and wantonness."[44]

In 2000, Dunst starred in the comedy _Bring It On_ as Torrance Shipman, the captain of a cheerleading squad.[45] The film generated mostly positive reviews,[46] with many critics reserving praise for her performance. In his review, A. O. Scott called her "a terrific comic actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt." Charles Taylor of _Salon_ noted that "among contemporary teenage actresses, Dunst has become the sunniest imaginable parodist", even though he thought the film had failed to provide her with as good a role as she had either in _Dick_ or in _The Virgin Suicides._[47] Jessica Winter from _The Village Voice_ complimented Dunst, stating that her performance was "as sprightly and knowingly daft as her turn in _Dick_" and commenting that "[Dunst] provides the only major element of _Bring It On_ that plays as tweaking parody rather than slick, strident, body-slam churlishness."[48] Peter Stack of the _San Francisco Chronicle_, despite giving the film an unfavorable review, commended Dunst for her willingness "to be as silly and cloyingly agreeable as it takes to get through a slapdash film."[49]

The following year, Dunst starred in the comedy film _Get Over It_ (2001).[50] She later explained that she took the role for the chance to sing.[51] Also in 2001, she starred in the historical drama _The Cat's Meow_, directed by Peter Bogdanovich, as the American actress Marion Davies. Derek Elley of _Variety_ described the film as "playful and sporty", saying that this was Dunst's best performance to date: "Believable as both a spoiled ingenue and a lover to two very different men, Dunst endows a potentially lightweight character with considerable depth and sympathy."[52] For her work, she won the Best Actress Silver Ombú category award at the 2002 Mar del Plata International Film Festival.[53]

2002–2009: _Spider-Man_ and mainstream recognition

premiere of _Marie Antoinette_]] In 2002, Dunst co-starred opposite Tobey Maguire in the superhero film _Spider-Man_, the most financially successful film of her career to date. She played Mary Jane Watson, the best friend and love interest of Peter Parker (Maguire). The film was directed by Sam Raimi. Owen Gleiberman of _Entertainment Weekly_ remarked on Dunst's ability to "lend even the smallest line a tickle of flirtatious music."[54] In the _Los Angeles Times_ review, critic Kenneth Turan noted that Dunst and Maguire made a real connection on screen, concluding that their relationship "involved audiences to an extent rarely seen in films."[55] _Spider-Man_ was a commercial and critical success.[56] The movie grossed $114 million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $822 million worldwide.[57]

Dunst next co-starred opposite Billy Bob Thornton, Morgan Freeman and Holly Hunter in Ed Solomon's drama _Levity_ (2003).[58] That same year, she co-starred opposite Julia Roberts, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Julia Stiles in the drama _Mona Lisa Smile_ (2003). The film received mostly negative reviews,[59] with Manohla Dargis of the _Los Angeles Times_ describing it as "smug and reductive."[60] She co-starred as Mary Svevo opposite Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet and Tom Wilkinson in Michel Gondry's science fiction romantic comedy-drama _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_ (2004).[61] The latter film received very positive reviews,[62] with _Entertainment Weekly_ describing Dunst's subplot as "nifty and clever".[63] The movie grossed $72 million worldwide.[64]

The success of the first _Spider-Man_ film led Dunst to reprise her role as Mary Jane Watson in 2004 in _Spider-Man 2_.[65] The movie was well received by critics[66] and a financial success, setting a new opening weekend box office record for North America.[67] With revenue of $783 million worldwide, it was the second highest-grossing film in 2004.[68] Also in 2004, Dunst co-starred opposite Paul Bettany in the romantic comedy _Wimbledon_ where she portrayed a rising tennis player in the Wimbledon Championships, while Bettany portrayed a fading former tennis star. The film received mixed reviews,[69] but many critics enjoyed Dunst's performance.[70][71] Claudia Puig of _USA Today_ reported that the chemistry between Dunst and Bettany was potent, with Dunst doing a fine job as a sassy and self-assured player.[72]

In 2005, she co-starred opposite Orlando Bloom in Cameron Crowe's romantic tragicomedy _Elizabethtown_ as Claire Colburn, a flight attendant. The film premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Dunst revealed that working with Crowe was enjoyable, but more demanding than she had expected.[73] The movie garnered mixed reviews,[74] with the _Chicago Tribune_ rating it one out of four stars and describing Dunst's portrayal of a flight attendant as "cloying."[75] It was a box office disappointment.[76]

In 2006, Dunst collaborated with Sofia Coppola again and starred as the title character in Coppola's historical drama _Marie Antoinette_, based on Antonia Fraser's book _Marie Antoinette: The Journey_.[77][78] The movie was screened at a special presentation at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival,[79] and was reviewed favourably.[80] International revenues were $45 million out of $60 million overall.[81]

In 2007, Dunst reprised her role as Mary Jane Watson in _Spider-Man 3_.[82] In contrast to the previous two films' positive reviews,[83][84] _Spider-Man 3_ received mixed reviews from critics.[85] Nonetheless, with a total worldwide gross of $891 million, it stands as the most commercially successful film in the series and Dunst's highest-grossing film to the end of 2008.[86] Having initially signed on for three _Spider-Man_ films, she said that she would do a fourth, but only if Raimi and Maguire also returned.[87] In January 2010, it was announced that the fourth film was cancelled and that the _Spider-Man_ film series would be restarted, and therefore dropping Dunst, Maguire and Raimi from the franchise.[88][89]

In 2008, Dunst co-starred opposite Simon Pegg in the comedy _How to Lose Friends & Alienate People_,[90] based on former _Vanity Fair_ contributing editor Toby Young's memoir of the same name.[91]

The film premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and received positive reviews and Dunst was singled out for praise. Steven Loeb of _Southampton Patch_ wrote, "This film has brought the best out of von Trier, as well as his star. Dunst is so good in this film, playing a character unlike any other she has ever attempted... Even if the film itself were not the incredible work of art that it is, Dunst's performance alone would be incentive enough to recommend it."[98]

Sukhdev Sandhu wrote from Cannes in _The Daily Telegraph_ that "Dunst is exceptional, so utterly convincing in the lead role – trouble, serene, a fierce savant – that it feels like a career breakthrough.[99] Dunst won several awards for her performance, including the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival[100][101] and the Best Actress Award from the U.S. National Society of Film Critics[102]

Dunst has signed to star in _Sweet Relief_ as Marla Ruzicka, a peace activist and U.S. relief worker killed by a suicide bomb in Baghdad.[103][104] She has expressed interest in playing the role of Blondie frontwoman Debbie Harry in Michel Gondry's upcoming biographical film about the band.[105][106]

In 2007, Dunst said she had no plans to release albums, saying, "It worked when Barbra Streisand was doing it, but now it's a little cheesy, I think. It works better when singers are in movies."[132]

Dunst starred as the magical princess Majokko in the Takashi Murakami and McG directed short _Akihabara Majokko Princess_ singing a cover of The Vapors' 1980 song "Turning Japanese".

In May 2008, she went public with this information in order to dispel rumors of drug and alcohol abuse, stating, "Now that I'm feeling stronger, I was prepared to say something.
