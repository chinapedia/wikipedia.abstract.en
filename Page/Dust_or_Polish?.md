_DUST OR POLISH?_ (1950) is a novel by Australian writer and artist Norman Lindsay.[1]


Story outline

The novel tells the story of ex-chorus girl Rita Aanson who goes into the second-hand furniture trade in the Sydney suburb of Paddington.


Critical reception

Reviewing the novel in _The Argus_ Gladys Hain noted a technique of Lindsay's: "Although Norman Lindsay's _Dust Or Polish_ is a quite well-knit story, it will hold the interest rather because of the author's little habit of putting his views on art – and artists – into the mouths of his characters, than because of any intrinsic merit as a literary effort."[2]

In _The Sydney Morning Herald_, the reviewer was full of praise: "Norman Lindsay's latest novel (his tenth) is a lively, vigorous work sprinkled with the wisdom and keen observations of a mature thinker, and written with the technical skill of an artist. The characters are vitally projected, the narrative flows smoothly and the novel is full of shrewd and thoughtful comments on art, life, manners, morals and, of course, the second-hand and period furniture business that provides an interesting background."[3]


Television adaptation

The novel was adapted for television in 1972. The television movie was directed by Julian Pringle, from a script by Peter Kenna, and featured Arthur Dignam, Sandy Gore, and Barbara Stephens. The drama was broadcast on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in October 1972.[4] It was part of a series of adaptations of Norman Lindsay works.[5]
