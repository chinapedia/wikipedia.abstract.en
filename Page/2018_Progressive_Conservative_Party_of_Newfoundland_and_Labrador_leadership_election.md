The PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OF NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR LEADERSHIP ELECTION, 2018 was held on April 27–29, 2018, to select a successor to Paul Davis who announced on October 11, 2016, that he planned to step down as leader once his replacement was elected.[1][2] St. John's lawyer Ches Crosbie defeated former Health Authority CEO Tony Wakeham. Crosbie won the leadership on the first ballot.[3] 11,000 members joined the party during this leadership election, of which, just over 4,000 cast their ballots.[4]


Timing

On October 11, 2016, Progressive Conservative Party leader Paul Davis announced that he had written party president Mark Whiffen and asked for a leadership convention to be called. Davis, who had been facing a leadership review at the party's upcoming convention, stated he would remain party leader until his successor was chosen.[5] Davis has since stated that will not rule out running again.[6] The party subsequently delayed the leadership vote until 2018 in order to give the party time to change its leadership election system in its constitution from delegated to a mix of one-member-one vote and points per district.

Election Period means the period of time which begins by the death, retirement or resignation or announcement of the retirement or resignation, of the Leader of the Party; or in which Article 15-2 of the Constitution applies. For the purposes of the leadership selection process occurring between 2016 and 2018 the election period began on October 11, 2016.

To become a candidate, a person must have filed nomination papers with the Chief Electoral Officer by January 15, 2018. To vote, a member of the public must have become a member of the party by January 30, 2018. The election was conducted by mail-in balloting with all party members (as of January 30, 2018) eligible to vote. Ballots must have been returned by April 25, 2018 and were opened and counted at the party's Annual General Meeting on April 28, 2018.[7][8]
