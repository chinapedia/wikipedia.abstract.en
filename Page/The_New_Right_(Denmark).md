THE NEW RIGHT ()[1] is a far-right political party in Denmark founded in 2015.


History

The party was founded in 2015 by two former members of the Conservative People's Party, Pernille Vermund and Peter Seier Christensen. After the establishment of the party, several municipal council members in several municipalities, switched from their original parties to the New Right.[2] Most of these were lost in the first election where they participated, the Danish local elections of 2017, where only one person from the party was elected for the municipal council in Hillerød.[3]

On 21 September 2016, the party announced that it had gathered the 20,109 signatures required to run for the next general election. This was confirmed by the Ministry of Social Affairs on 6 October.[4]


Positions

The party criticises the immigration policies of right-wing populist Danish People's Party (DF) as being "too lenient". The New Right wants Denmark to step out of the UN refugee convention and to deport all immigrants who live on temporary residence or are not able to support themselves.[5] Only foreigners directly allotted to Denmark by UN refugee agencies should be granted asylum. Danish citizenship should be restricted to people who "contribute positively" to society. Moreover, the party wants to completely ban the Islamic headscarf from schools and public institutions.[6]

Its economic policies are libertarian (unlike the economically "social democratic" DF), calling for tax cuts and the abolishment of all corporate taxes.[7] Moreover, The New Right want to end Denmark's membership in the European Union which they consider a "monstrosity of rules and laws", threatening "Denmark’s prosperity, progress and democracy",[8] and want laws in general to be fewer in number.[9]

Observers place the party further to the right than DF,[10][11] whose voters The New Right mainly target, according to a Gallup poll.[12]

In the Danish general election, 2019, the Progress Party will support The New Right, because they "have taken over the Progress Party's old messages".[13]
