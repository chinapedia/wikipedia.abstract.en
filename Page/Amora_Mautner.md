AMORA MAUTNER (born May 24, 1975) is an International Emmy-nominated Brazilian television director and former actress. She has worked in many _telenovelas_ and TV series broadcast by Rede Globo.


Biography

Mautner was born in Rio de Janeiro on May 24, 1975. She is the only daughter of famous singer and writer Jorge Mautner and historian Ruth Mendes, and is of Austrian-Jewish and Yugoslav descent on her father's side. She initially debuted as an actress, portraying Paula in the 1991–92 _telenovela_ _Vamp_, and also appeared in an episode of the TV series _Você Decide_, but later abandoned the acting career to become involved in directing.[1]

She debuted as assistant director in the first season of the long-running soap opera _Malhação_ in 1995, but wouldn't direct her first _telenovela_ until _O Cravo e a Rosa_ from 2000. In 2012, Mautner and Ricardo Waddington (who would become one of her most frequent collaborators) won the Prêmio Contigo! de TV, in the category "Best Director", for _Cordel Encantado_. After her work in the successful _Avenida Brasil_ which was nominated to the International Emmy Award for Best Telenovela, (which won her yet another Prêmio Contigo! de TV for Best Director in 2013) and _Joia Rara_, she was promoted to Rede Globo's art director in 2014.[2]

On an interview to _Época_ magazine from September 15, 2016, she stated that after she ended work on her most recent _telenovela_, _A Regra do Jogo_ (2015–16), which was nominated to the International Emmy Award for Best Telenovela, she took a temporary break from TV in order to begin work on her first full-length film, an adaptation of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel _The Gambler_. It will enter pre-production in 2017, after she finds a screenwriter and an appropriate actor for the leading role, and shooting will begin in Argentina in 2018.[3] On June 26, 2017, she expressed her desire to direct a film adaptation of Raphael Montes' 2014 thriller novel _Dias Perfeitos_.[4] She is slated to return to television in 2018, to direct the upcoming _telenovela_ _Sal da Terra_, by Duca Rachid and Thelma Guedes, who also wrote _Joia Rara_.[5]

On December 19, 2016, it was reported that she began work on a miniseries based on Dostoyevsky's _The Brothers Karamazov_, scheduled to be broadcast in 2018 by Rede Globo; Caio Blat and Carolina Dieckmann are being eyed to star.[6] In 2017 she was chosen to direct the biographical miniseries _Assédio_, written by Maria Camargo and inspired by the non-fiction book _A Clínica_, by Vicente Vilardaga, about the life and crimes of rapist and former physician Roger Abdelmassih, who was portrayed by Antonio Calloni. The series' 10 episodes premiered on September 21, 2018 on Globo's streaming service Globoplay.[7][8]

Despite her success, Mautner is often criticized by the actors she has worked with and other acquaintances as being too "strict" and "perfectionist".[9][10] In 2017 it was reported that she fell out in favor with many of Rede Globo's _telenovela_ writers, allegedly because of her "temperamental" demeanor, creative divergences with João Emanuel Carneiro and the lukewarm reception of _A Regra do Jogo_.[11][12]


Personal life

Mautner was married to actor Marcos Palmeira from 2005 to 2012.[13] The couple had a daughter, Júlia, born 2007.[14]

Since 2015 Mautner is dating Arnon Affonso, son of former Brazilian President Fernando Collor.[15]
