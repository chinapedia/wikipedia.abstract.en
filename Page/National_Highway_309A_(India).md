Renumbered_National_Highways_map_of_India_(Schematic).jpg NATIONAL HIGHWAY 309A, commonly referred to as NH 309A, is a single lane highway connecting the city of Rameshwar to Almora in the Indian State of Uttarakhand.[1] Before the separation of Uttarakhand in 2000, the Almora-Bageshwar stretch of this Highway was a part of the State Highway 37 of Uttar Pradesh, which ran from Bageshwar to Bareilly.[2]


History

The Almora-Bageshwar stretch of this Highway was a part of the provincial 'Almora-Joshimath cart road' during the nineteenth century.[3] The road had a steep descent on the way to Thakla (now Takula), and was surrounded by dense forests of Oak and Rhododendrons. However, the hills were covered by very fine Cheer forests between Thakla and Bageshwar.[4] Later in 1909; several sections of the highway were recorded in the Almora Gazetter as "III class local roads", including the 24 mile 'Gangolihat to Dharamghar road' and the 22 mile 'Bageshwar to Berinag road'.[5]
