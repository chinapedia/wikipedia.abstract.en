Conjugation_of_verb-es.svg verb _correr_, "to run", the lexeme is "corr-".
Red represents the speaker, purple the addressee and teal a third person.

Dawn represents the past, noon the present and night the future.]] In linguistics, CONJUGATION () is the creation of derived forms of a verb from its principal parts by inflection (alteration of form according to rules of grammar). Verbs may inflect for grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, tense, aspect, mood, voice, case, possession, definiteness, politeness, causativity, clusivity, interrogativity, transitivity, valency, polarity, telicity, volition, mirativity, evidentiality, animacy, associativity,[1] pluractionality, and reciprocity. Verbs may also be affected by agreement, polypersonal agreement, incorporation, noun class, noun classifiers, and verb classifiers.[2] Agglutinative and polysynthetic languages tend to have the most complex conjugations albeit some fusional languages such as Archi can also have extremely complex conjugation. Typically the principal parts are the root and/or several modifications of it (stems). All the different forms of the same verb constitute a lexeme, and the canonical form of the verb that is conventionally used to represent that lexeme (as seen in dictionary entries) is called a lemma.

The term conjugation is applied only to the inflection of verbs, and not of other parts of speech (inflection of nouns and adjectives is known as declension). Also it is often restricted to denoting the formation of finite forms of a verb – these may be referred to as _conjugated forms_, as opposed to non-finite forms, such as the infinitive or gerund, which tend not to be marked for most of the grammatical categories.

CONJUGATION is also the traditional name for a group of verbs that share a similar conjugation pattern in a particular language (a _verb class_). For example, Latin is said to have four conjugations of verbs. This means that any regular Latin verb can be conjugated in any person, number, tense, mood, and voice by knowing which of the four conjugation groups it belongs to, and its principal parts. A verb that does not follow all of the standard conjugation patterns of the language is said to be an irregular verb. The system of all conjugated variants of a particular verb or class of verbs is called a VERB PARADIGM; this may be presented in the form of a CONJUGATION TABLE.


Examples

Indo-European languages usually inflect verbs for several grammatical categories in complex paradigms, although some, like English, have simplified verb conjugation to a large extent. Below is the conjugation of the verb _to be_ in the present tense (of the infinitive, if it exists, and indicative moods), in English, German, Yiddish, Dutch, Afrikaans, Icelandic, Faroese, Swedish, Norwegian, Latvian, Bulgarian, Serbo-Croatian, Polish, Slovenian, Macedonian, Urdu or Hindi, Persian, Latin, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Albanian, Armenian, Irish, Ukrainian, Ancient Attic Greek and Modern Greek. This is usually the most irregular verb. The similarities in corresponding verb forms may be noticed. Some of the conjugations may be disused, like the English _thou_-form, or have additional meanings, like the English _you_-form, which can also stand for second person singular or be impersonal.

: |"To be" in several Indo-European languages

    ¹ Archaic, poetical; used only with the pronoun 'thou'.
    ² In Flemish dialects.
    ³ In the bokmål written standard.
    ⁴ In the nynorsk written standard. _vera_ and _vere_ are both alternate forms.
    ⁵ Attic.
    ⁶ 'eínai' is only used as a noun ("being, existence").
    ⁷ Ptc: qenë.
    ⁸ In the Tosk and Geg dialects, respectively.
    ⁹ Existential: هست (hæst) has another meaning. Usage of (_æ_) is considered to be rural, now. See, Indo-European copula


Verbal agreement

VERBAL AGREEMENT or CONCORD is a morpho-syntactic construct in which properties of the subject and/or objects of a verb are indicated by the verb form. Verbs are then said to agree with their subjects (resp. objects).

Many English verbs exhibit subject agreement of the following sort: whereas _I go_, _you go_, _we go_, _they go_ are all grammatical in standard English, _she go_ is not (except in the subjunctive, as "They requested that _she go_ with them"). Instead, a special form of the verb _to go_ has to be used to produce _she goes_. On the other hand _I goes_, _you goes_ etc. are not grammatical in standard English. (Things are different in some English dialects that lack agreement.) A few English verbs have no special forms that indicate subject agreement (_I may_, _you may_, _she may_), and the verb _to be_ has an additional form _am_ that can only be used with the pronoun _I_ as the subject.

Verbs in written French exhibit more intensive agreement morphology than English verbs: _je suis_ (I am), _tu es_ ("you are", singular informal), _elle est_ (she is), _nous sommes_ (we are), _vous êtes_ ("you are", plural), _ils sont_ (they are). Historically, English used to have a similar verbal paradigm. Some historic verb forms are used by Shakespeare as slightly archaic or more formal variants (_I do_, _thou dost_, _she doth_, typically used by nobility) of the modern forms.

Some languages with verbal agreement can leave certain subjects implicit when the subject is fully determined by the verb form. In Spanish, for instance, subject pronouns do not need to be explicitly present, even though in French, its close relative, they are obligatory. The Spanish equivalent to the French _je suis_ (I am) can be simply _soy_ (lit. "am"). The pronoun _yo_ (I) in the explicit form _yo soy_ is only required for emphasis or to clear ambiguity in complex texts.

Some languages have a richer agreement system in which verbs also agree with some or all of their objects. Ubykh exhibits verbal agreement for the subject, direct object, indirect object, benefaction and ablative objects (_a.w3.s.xe.n.t'u.n_, _you gave it to him for me_).

Basque can show agreement not only for subject, direct object and indirect object, but it also on occasion exhibits agreement for the listener as the implicit benefactor: _autoa ekarri digute_ means "they brought us the car" (neuter agreement for listener), but _autoa ekarri ziguten_ means "they brought us the car" (agreement for feminine singular listener).

Languages with a rich agreement morphology facilitate relatively free word order without leading to increased ambiguity. The canonical word order in Basque is subject–object–verb. However, all permutations of subject, verb and object are permitted.

Nonverbal person agreement

In some languages,[3] predicative adjectives and copular complements receive a form of person agreement that is distinct from that used on ordinary predicative verbs. Although this is a form of conjugation in that it refers back to the person of the subject, it is not “verbal” because it always derives from pronouns that have become cliticised to the nouns to which they refer.[4] An example of nonverbal person agreement, along with contrasting verbal conjugation, can be found from Beja[5] (person agreement affixes in bold):

-   _wun.tu.WI_, “you (fem.) are big”
-   _hadá.b.WA_, “you (masc.) are a sheik”
-   _E.n.fór_, “he flees”

Another example can be found from Ket:[6]

-   _fèmba.DI_, “I am a Tungus”
-   _DƗ.fen_, “I am standing”

In Turkic, and a few Uralic and Australian Aboriginal languages, predicative adjectives and copular complements take affixes that are identical to those used on predicative verbs, but their negation is different. For example, in Turkish:

-   _koş.u.yor.SUN_ “you are running”
-   _çavuş.SUN_ “you are a sergeant”

Under negation this becomes (negative affixes in bold):

-   _koş.MU.yor.sun_ “you are not running”
-   _çavuş DEĞIL.sin_ “you are not a sergeant”

For this reason, the person agreement affixes used with predicative adjectives and nominals in Turkic languages are considered to be nonverbal in character. In some analyses, they are viewed as a form of verbal takeover by a copular strategy.


Factors that affect conjugation

Common grammatical categories according to which verbs can be conjugated are the following:

-   Finite verb forms:
    -   Grammatical person
    -   Grammatical number
    -   Grammatical gender
    -   Grammatical tense
    -   Grammatical aspect
    -   Grammatical mood
    -   Grammatical voice
-   Non-finite verb forms.

Other factors which may affect conjugation are:

-   Degree of formality (see T-V distinction, Honorific speech in Japanese, Korean speech levels)
-   Clusivity (of personal pronouns)
-   Transitivity
-   Valency
