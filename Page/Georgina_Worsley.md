_' Georgina, Marchioness of Stockbridge_' (née GEORGINA WORSLEY, born 28 November 1895), is a fictional character in the British television series, _Upstairs, Downstairs_. She was portrayed by Lesley-Anne Down.

Georgina Worsley arrives to live at Eaton Place in 1913. She is the step-daughter of Lady Marjorie's brother Hugo Talbot-Carey (the new Earl of Southwold). His new wife is the widow Marion Worsely, and mother of Georgina by her previous marriage. Georgina's natural father died in a hunting accident when she was six years old. Her mother and step-father die along with Lady Marjorie in the sinking of the _RMS Titanic_ in 1912. After that she moves into 165 Eaton Place right before Christmas in December 1913.

She spends the war years serving in France as a VAD Nurse, where her patients include her step-cousin James. During the 1920s, she joins the ranks of young people known as the "Bright Young Things"—silly, giddy, empty-headed types—but changes her ways after she accidentally runs over and kills a Penfold Farm cowherder. She is saved by the testimony of Robert, Marquess of Stockbridge, whom she marries on 12 June 1930.
