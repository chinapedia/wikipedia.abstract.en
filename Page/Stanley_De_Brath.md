STANLEY DE BRATH (10 October 1854 – 20 December 1937) was a British civil engineer, psychical researcher and spiritualist.[1]


Career

Brath was born in Sydenham, Kent. He worked as a civil engineer in India for 17 years.[2] He was most well known for his book _Psychic Philosophy as the Foundation of a Religion of Natural Law_, published in 1896. Alfred Russel Wallace had written an introduction for the book and considered it of "great lucidity, a philosophy of the universe and of human nature in its threefold aspect of body, soul, and spirit". The book was expanded in 1908 and endorsed by Wallace in a prefatory note.[3]

Brath was a Christian and believed that both Christianity and spiritualism were compatible.[4]

Brath also translated a number of psychical research books into English. He translated Charles Richet's _Thirty Years of Psychical Research_ (1923).[5]

He was the editor of _Psychic Science_ a journal published by the British College of Psychic Science.[6]

His books were criticized by the scientific community. The sociologist Guy Benton Johnson ridiculed _Psychical Research, Science, and Religion_ in a review as an anti-scientific work and only "grand-reading if you have a sense of humor."[7]
