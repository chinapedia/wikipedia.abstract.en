Reception

_Dot._ currently holds a 7.6/10 on IMDB from 22 reviews.[22] It got a 5/5 on Common Sense Media, quoting:

"Parents need to know that Dot. is based on a picture book by Randi Zuckerberg and centers on a curious 8-year-old who uses technology, math, and science concepts to learn new things, but it's never at the expense of real-world experiences and the people she cares about. For Dot and her family, it's all about balance, so much attention is given to the times when she acknowledges she's ready to unplug. The show sets out to expose kids -- and girls in particular -- to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) concepts in an inviting, age-appropriate way through the likable, self-confident titular character. As a bonus, it presents Dot's parents as her role models and educator, and her friends as positive influences in her life."[23]


Media information

An HTML game called Dot's Rangeroo Scavenger Hunt is available on Kids' CBC and Sprout's websites. Another game, inspired by Atari's earliest arcade game Pong, _Make a Game with Dot_, is available on the Sprout website as well. An app, _Dotopedia_, for Android and iOS devices was also released on December 12, 2016.
