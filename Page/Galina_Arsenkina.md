GALINA PETROVNA ARSENKINA (; born 6 June 1991) is a Russian curler from Moscow.[1] She played second for the Russia women's national curling team at the 2016 European Curling Championships.


Career

She started her sports career as a figure skater, but when she was 12 years old, a leg injury forced her to give up the sport. At that point, she took up curling.[2]

After joining the CC Moscow-1 in 2007, Arsenkina won five championships of Russia with the team. In 2015, she switched to the CC Krasnodarsky Kray in Sochi.
