A CUSTOMS UNION is generally defined as a type of trade bloc which is composed of a free trade area with a common external tariff.[1] Customs unions are established through trade pacts where the participant countries set up common external trade policy (in some cases they use different import quotas). Common competition policy is also helpful to avoid _competition deficiency_.[2]

Purposes for establishing a customs union normally include increasing economic efficiency and establishing closer political and cultural ties between the member countries. It is the third stage of economic integration.

Every economic union, customs and monetary union and economic and monetary union includes a customs union.
