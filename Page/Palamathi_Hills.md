At the foot of Palamathi hills is the Otteri Lake. The lake was man made in the British era to supply water to Vellore.[4] The lake is also a thriving hotspot for various avians as it is undisturbed by the city's pollution and is located in the periphery of the city. The lake reached its maximum capacity in 2015 due to heavy rains.[5] Another place of interest in Palamathi is the Bala Murugan Temple, situated atop the hill.
