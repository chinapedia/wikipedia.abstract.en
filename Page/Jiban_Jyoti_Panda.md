Dr. JIBAN JYOTI PANDA is an Indian scientist specializing in the field of nano-biotechnology. She has been awarded numerous awards in recognition for her work including the UNESCO - L`Oreal For Women in Science Fellowship,[1] [2] [3] which recognizes the achievements of exceptional women across the globe.


Education

Dr. Jyoti Panda started her education by enrolling at Utkal University in the state of Odisha in India. She completed her Bachelor of Science (Honours) in chemistry, zoology and botany in 2003. She subsequently completed her Master of Science degree in the field of biotechnology from the same university in 2005. Later, she went on to complete a Ph.D. in biotechnology at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, India, in 2012.[4]


Research

Her primary interests are in the field of Nano-biotechnology. She works on the design and synthesis of novel bio-compatible and multi-functional nano-structures for achieving targeted and effective drug delivery to different organs especially the organs like brain and eye, which are protected by different physiological barriers and are inaccessible to drugs administered via the oral and parenteral routes.[5] She also designs bio-compatible drug delivery systems for effective cancer therapy.[6] [7][8]

Developing novel methods for effective blood brain barrier delivery for treating glioblastomas and other neurodegenerative disorders as well as developing and characterizing different drug nano-formulations with enhanced activity are also her main focus of research. She has published numerous papers in peer reviewed journals.[9]
