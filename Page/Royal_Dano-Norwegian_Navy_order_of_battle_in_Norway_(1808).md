ROYAL DANO-NORWEGIAN NAVY ORDER OF BATTLE IN NORWAY IN 1808

Following the loss of the Danish-Norwegian fleet at the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807 and of the last ship-of-the line, _Prinds Christian Frederick_, at Zealand Point in March 1808, Denmark-Norway were forced to adopt the method of defence later known as the Gunboat War. Lacking the time and resources to build a new battle fleet, they concentrated on smaller craft capable of carrying heavy, long range cannon viz. gunboats that were effective in the calmer, narrower inshore waters, but could not challenge enemy warships in rougher seas.[1]
For the rougher waters of the Norwegian Sea from 1808 onward, a new class of gunship, the seaworthy 50-man pine-built Norske Kanonskonnert were to be built in Bergen and Trondheim. Ten such gunships were constructed before 1814, and more after Norway achieved independence from Denmark[2].
