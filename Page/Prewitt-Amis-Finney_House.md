The PREWITT-AMIS-FINNEY HOUSE, also known as TURNHILL FARM, is a historic three-story house in Culleoka, Tennessee, U.S.. Built for the slaveholding Prewett family in 1810, it was established as a mule farm. It is located a few miles away from Columbia, and it overlooks Fountain Creek.


History

The house was built in 1810 by Lemuel Prewett, his wife Elizabeth and their 12 children.[1] The Prewett raised mules on their farm; they also owned African slaves.[2] After the Creek War of 1813-1814, the house was inherited by Lemuel Prewett's son Abner, and the Prewetts moved to Mississippi in the 1820s.[3]

The house was purchased by John Amis, his wife and their six children, in 1821.[4] Amis, the owner of 16 slaves, served on the county court.[5] In 1852, he died of cholera alongside his wife and his son John; the three of them were buried on the farm.[6] The house was inherited by their daughter, Elizabeth Amis Cheatham, and her husband, John Cheatham.[7]

The house was purchased by James I. Finney, Sr. in 1935.[8] He redesigned it in the Colonial Revival architectural style, and he renamed it Turnhill Farm.[9]

The house has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since December 1, 1997.[10]
