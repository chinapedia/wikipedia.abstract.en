The KADDISH or QADDISH (, _qaddiš_ "holy"; alternative spelling: ḲADDISH) is a hymn of praises to God found in Jewish prayer services. The central theme of the _Kaddish_ is the magnification and sanctification of God's name. In the liturgy, different versions of the Kaddish are used functionally as separators between sections of the service.

The term "Kaddish" is often used to refer specifically to "The Mourner's Kaddish", said as part of the mourning rituals in Judaism in all prayer services, as well as at funerals (other than at the gravesite, see _Qaddish aḥar Haqqəvurah_ "Qaddish after Burial") and memorials, and for 11 months after the death of a close relative. When mention is made of "saying Kaddish", this unambiguously refers to the rituals of mourning. Mourners say Kaddish to show that despite the loss they still praise God.

The opening words of this prayer are inspired by , a vision of God becoming great in the eyes of all the nations. The central line of the Kaddish in Jewish tradition is the congregation's response: (_Yǝhē šmēh rabbā mǝvārakh lǝʿālam u-lʿalmē ʿālmayyā_, "May His great name be blessed for ever, and to all eternity"), a public declaration of God's greatness and eternality.[1] This response is an Aramaic translation of the Hebrew "" (Blessed be His name, whose glorious kingdom is forever), which is to be found in the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan (, Genesis 49:2 and Deuteronomy 6:4), and is similar to the wording of .

The Mourners, Rabbis and Complete Kaddish end with a supplication for peace ("Oseh Shalom..."), which is in Hebrew, and is somewhat similar to the Tanakh .

Along with the Shema Yisrael and Amidah, the Kaddish is one of the most important and central elements in the Jewish liturgy. Kaddish cannot be recited alone. Along with some prayers, it can only be recited with a minyan of ten Jews.


History and background

"The Kaddish is in origin a closing doxology to an Aggadic discourse."[2] Most of it is written in Aramaic, which, at the time of its original composition, was the lingua franca of the Jewish people. It is not composed in the vernacular Aramaic, however, but rather in a "literary, jargon Aramaic" that was used in the academies, and is identical to the dialect of the Targum.[3]

Professor Yoel Elitzur, however, argues that the Kaddish was originally written in Hebrew, and later translated to Aramaic to be better understood by the masses. He notes that quotations from the Kaddish in the Talmud and Sifrei are in Hebrew, and that even today some of the words are Hebrew rather than Aramaic.[4]

The oldest version of the Kaddish is found in the _Siddur of Rab Amram Gaon_, c. 900. Shira Schoenberg observes that "The first mention of MOURNERS saying Kaddish at the end of the service is in a 13th century halakhic writing by Isaac ben Moses of Vienna, the _Or Zarua_ ("Light is Sown"). The Kaddish at the end of the service became designated as _Kaddish Yatom_ or Mourner's Kaddish (literally, "Orphan's Kaddish").[5]


Variant forms

The various versions of the Kaddish are:

-   _Ḥaṣi Qaddish_ (חצי קדיש 'Half Kaddish') or _Qaddish Lʿela_ (קדיש לעלא), sometimes called the _Reader's Kaddish_
-   _Qaddish Yatom_ (קדיש יתום) or _Qaddish Yehe Shlama Rabba_ (קדיש יהא שלמא רבא)literally 'Orphan's Kaddish', although commonly referred to as _Qaddish Avelim_ (קדיש אבלים), the 'Mourner's Kaddish'
-   _Qaddish Shalem_ (קדיש שלם) or _Qaddish Titkabbal_ (קדיש תתקבל)literally "Complete Kaddish" or "Whole Kaddish"
-   _Qaddish de Rabbanan_ (קדיש דרבנן 'Kaddish of the Rabbis') or _Qaddish ʿal Yisraʾel_ (קדיש על ישראל)
-   _Qaddish aḥar Haqqvura_ (קדיש אחר הקבורה)literally 'Kaddish after a Burial', also called _Kaddish d'Ithadata_ (קדיש דאתחדתא) after one of the first distinguishing words in this variant
-   _Qaddish aḥar Hashlamat Masechet_ (קדיש אחר השלמת מסכת)literally, 'Kaddish after the completion of a tractate', i.e. at a siyum (in Sefardi practice, same as _Qaddish de Rabbanan_), also called _Qaddish haGadol_ (קדיש הגדול 'the Great Qaddish'), as it is the longest Kaddish

All versions of the Kaddish begin with the _Hatzi Kaddish_ (there are some extra passages in the Kaddish after a burial or a siyum). The longer versions contain additional paragraphs, and are often named after distinctive words in those paragraphs.

The Half Kaddish is used to punctuate divisions within the service: for example, before Barechu, after the Amidah, and following readings from the Torah. The _Kaddish d'Rabbanan_ is used after any part of the service that includes extracts from the Mishnah or the Talmud, as its original purpose was to close a study session. _Kaddish Titkabbal_ originally marked the end of the service, though in later times extra passages and hymns were added to follow it.

The _Jewish Encyclopedia_{{'}}s article on Kaddish mentions an additional type of Kaddish, called _Qaddish Yahid_ "Individual's Kaddish".[6] This is included in the _Siddur of Amram Gaon_, but is a meditation taking the place of Kaddish rather than a Kaddish in the normal sense.

Recent additions to Oseh Shalom

In some recent prayerbooks, for example, the American Reform Machzor,[7] line 36 is replaced with:

  ---- ----------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------- ----
  36   all Israel, and all who dwell on earth; and let us say: _Amen_.   _v'al kol isra'el, v'al kol yoshve tevel; v'imru: Amen._   __
  ---- ----------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------- ----

This effort to extend the reach of Oseh Shalom to non-Jews is said to have been started by the British Liberal Jewish movement in 1967, with the introduction of _v'al kol bnai Adam_ ("and upon all humans");[8] these words continue to be used by some in the UK.[9]

Notes

-   Bracketed text varies according to personal or communal traditions.
-   (A) The congregation responds with "amen" (אָמֵן) after lines 1, 4, 7, 12, 15, 18, 27, 33, 36. In the Ashkenazi tradition, the response to line 12 is "Blessed be he" (בְּרִיךְ הוּא _b'rikh hu_).

-   (B) On line 1, some say _Yitgaddeyl veyitqaddeysh_ rather than _Yitgaddal veyitqaddash_, because the roots of these two words are Hebrew and not Aramaic (the Aramaic equivalent would be _Yitrabay veyitkadash_), some authorities (but not others) felt that both words should be rendered in pure Hebrew pronunciation.[10]

-   (C) Line 13: in the Ashkenazi tradition the repeated "le'ela" is used only during the Ten Days of Repentance. In the Sephardi tradition it is never used. In the Yemenite tradition it is the invariable wording. The phrase "le'ela le'ela" is the Targum's translation of the Hebrew "ma'la ma'la" (Deuteronomy 28:43).

-   (D) Lines 4 and 30–32 are not present in the Ashkenazi tradition. "Revaḥ vehatzala" is said aloud by the congregation.

-   (E) Line 26: some Sephardi Jews say _malka_ [or _maram_ or _mareh_] _di-shmaya ve-ar'a_ (the King [or Master] of Heaven and Earth) instead of _avuhon de-vi-shmaya_ (their Father in Heaven); De Sola Pool uses _mara_; the London Spanish and Portuguese Jews use the same text as the Ashkenazim.[11]

-   (F) During the "complete kaddish" some include the following congregational responses, which are not regarded as part of the text:

    -   Before line 16, "accept our prayer with mercy and favour"
    -   Before line 28, "May the name of God be blessed, from now and forever" ()
    -   Before line 34, "My help is from God, creator of heaven and earth" ()

-   (G) Line 35: "b'rahamav" is used by Sephardim in all versions of kaddish; by Ashkenazim only in "Kaddish deRabbanan".

-   (H) Line 36: "ammo" is used by most Sephardim, but not by some of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews or Ashkenazim.

-   (I) Lines 37 to 45: these lines are also recited by Yemenite Jews as part of every Kaddish DeRabbanan.

-   (Z) In line 22, the bracketed word is added in the Land of Israel.

-   In line 1, as noted in (a), the congregation responds "Amen", even though this commonly is not printed in most prayerbooks. This longstanding and widespread tradition actually introduces a break in the verse which may lead to misinterpretation as the phrase "according to His will" would then appear to apply only to "which he created" instead of to "Magnified and sanctified".[12]
-   It is common that the entire congregation recites lines 8 and 9 with the leader, and it is also common that the congregation will include in its collective recitation the first word of the next line (line 10), _Yitbarakh_. This is commonly thought to be done to prevent any interruption before the next line (which begins with _Yitbarakh_) is recited by the leader. But this inclusion of _Yitbarakh_ has not always been the case. Maimonides and the Tur did not include it in the congregation's recitation; Amram Gaon, the Vilna Gaon, and the Shulchan Aruch include it.[13]


Customs

The Kaddish, as used in the services on special days is chanted. There are different melodies in different Jewish traditions and within each tradition the melody can change according to the version, the day it is said and even the position in the service; many mourners recite it slowly and contemplatively.

-   Virtual Cantor's Kaddish Shalem for Shabbat Mussaf
-   Virtual Cantor's Hatzi Kaddish for Yom Kippur

In Sephardi synagogues the whole congregation sits for Kaddish, except:

-   during the Kaddish immediately before the Amidah, where everyone stands;
-   during the Mourner's Kaddish, where those reciting it stand and everyone else sits.

In Ashkenazi synagogues, the custom varies. Very commonly, in both Orthodox and Reform congregations, everyone stands for the mourner's kaddish; but in some (especially many Conservative and Hasidic) synagogues, most of the congregants sit. Sometimes, a distinction is made between the different forms of Kaddish, or each congregant stands or sits according to his or her own custom. The Mourner's Kaddish is often treated differently from the other variations of Kaddish in the service, as is the Half Kaddish before the maftir.[14]

Those standing to recite the Kaddish bow, by widespread tradition, at various places. Generally: At the first word of the prayer, at each _Amen_, at _Yitbarakh_, at _Brikh hu_, and for the last verse (_Oseh shalom_). For _Oseh shalom_ it is customary take three steps back (if possible) then bow to one's left, then to one's right, and finally bow forward, as if taking leave of the presence of a king, in the same way as when the same words are used as the concluding line of the Amidah.[15]

Minyan requirement

_Masekhet Soferim_, an eighth-century compilation of Jewish laws regarding the preparation of holy books and public reading, states (Chapter 10:7) that Kaddish may be recited only in the presence of a minyan (a quorum of at least 10 men in Orthodox Judaism or 10 adults in Reform and Conservative Judaism).[16] While the traditional view is that "if kaddish is said in private, then by definition it is not kaddish,"[17] some alternatives have been suggested, including the _Kaddish L'yachid_ ("Kaddish for an individual"),[18] attributed to ninth-century Gaon Amram bar Sheshna,[19] and the use of kavanah prayer, asking heavenly beings to join with the individual "to make a minyan of both Earth and heaven".[20] In some Reform congregations, a minyan is not required for recitation of the Kaddish, but other Reform congregations disagree and believe that the Kaddish should be said publicly.[21]


Mourner's Kaddish

MOURNER'S KADDISH[22] is said at all prayer services and certain other occasions. It is written in Aramaic.[23] It takes the form of _Kaddish Yehe Shelama Rabba_, and is traditionally recited several times, most prominently at or towards the end of the service, after the Aleinu and/or closing Psalms and/or (on the Sabbath) Ani'im Zemirot. Following the death of a child, spouse, or sibling it is customary to recite the Mourner's Kaddish in the presence of a congregation daily for thirty days, or eleven months in the case of a parent,[24][25] and then at every anniversary of the death called a Yahrtzeit.[26] The "mourner" who says the Kaddish will be any person present at a service who has the obligation to recite Kaddish in accordance with these rules.

Customs for reciting the Mourner's Kaddish vary markedly among various communities. In Sephardi synagogues, the custom is that all the mourners stand and chant the Kaddish together. In Ashkenazi synagogues, the earlier custom was that one mourner be chosen to lead the prayer on behalf of the rest, though most congregations have now adopted the Sephardi custom. In many Reform synagogues, the entire congregation recites the Mourner's Kaddish together. This is sometimes said to be for those victims of the Holocaust who have no one left to recite the Mourner's Kaddish on their behalf and in support of the mourners.[27] In some congregations (especially Reform and Conservative ones), the Rabbi will read a list of the deceased who have a Yahrzeit on that day (or who have died within the past month), and then ask the congregants to name any people they are mourning for. Some synagogues, especially Orthodox and Conservative ones, try to multiply the number of times that the Mourner's Kaddish is recited, for example, reciting a separate Mourner's Kaddish after both Aleinu and then each closing Psalm. Other synagogues limit themselves to one Mourner's Kaddish at the end of the service.

It is important to note that the Mourner's Kaddish does not mention death at all, but instead praises God. Though the Kaddish is often popularly referred to as the "Jewish Prayer for the Dead," that designation more accurately belongs to the prayer called "El Malei Rachamim", which specifically prays for the soul of the deceased. The Mourner's Kaddish can be more accurately represented as an expression of "justification for judgement" by the mourners on behalf of their loved ones. It is believed that this version of the Kaddish was adopted by mourners around the 13th century during harsh persecution of Jews by crusaders in Germany because of the opening messianic line about God bringing the dead back to life (though this line is not in many modern versions).

Women and the Mourner's Kaddish

Though there is evidence of some women saying the Mourner's Kaddish for their parents at the grave, during shiva, and in daily prayers since the 17th century, and though R. Bacharach ruled on the matter in "the Amsterdam case" and concluded that women could recite the Mourner's Kaddish, this is still controversial in the Orthodox communities with various rabbis restricting the ruling.[28] Despite these restrictions, recitation of the Mourner's Kaddish by Orthodox Jewish women is now becoming more common.[29] In 2013 the Israeli Orthodox rabbinical organization Beit Hillel issued a halachic ruling which allows women to say the Kaddish in memory of their deceased parents.[30] In Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist Judaism, the Mourner's Kaddish is traditionally said by women who are also counted in the minyan.[31]

[24] The rule is daily recitation for one month from the date of burial for a sibling, child, or spouse, but eleven months for a parent though the full mourning period is twelve months. The Mourner's Kaddish is recited for a shorter period so as not to imply that one's parent was a sinner.
