Saint Kitts and Nevis has no major international disputes. Its status as a transshipment point for South American drugs destined for the United States and Europe has caused some tension with foreign countries.

It has diplomatic relations through the Kittitian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the Republic of China on Taiwan (not to be confused with the People's Republic of China). St. Kitts and Nevis also maintains diplomatic relations with the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Armenia, France, Finland[1]Greece,[2], Iceland[3], Romania[4] Israel,[5] Russia, Cuba, Switzerland,[6] Japan[7] and South Korea, as well as with many Latin American countries and neighboring Eastern Caribbean states.

Multilateral relations

Saint Kitts and Nevis are a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the United Nations and several of its specialized and related agencies, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, the Eastern Caribbean Regional Security System (RSS), and the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) and Non Aligned Movement. The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank is headquartered in St. Kitts.

As a member of CARICOM St. Kitts and Nevis strongly backed efforts by the United States to implement UN Security Council Resolution 940, designed to facilitate the departure of Haiti's de facto authorities from power. St. Kitts contributed personnel to the multinational force which restored the democratically elected government of Haiti in October 1994.
