MICOLA is an unincorporated community in Pemiscot County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]


History

Micola was originally called Pokono, and under the latter had its start in 1901 when the railroad was extended to that point.[2] A post office called Micola was established in 1902, and remained in operation until 1926.[3] The present name is a fanciful amalgamation of Michie and Coleman, the surnames of the original owners of the town site.[4]
