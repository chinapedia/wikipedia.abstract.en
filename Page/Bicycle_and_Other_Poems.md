Critical reception

In a survey of three poetry collections from the University of Queensland Press, Geoffrey Page in _The Canberra Times_ called this book "remarkable for its perception (particularly where personal experience is made universal) and for its verbal freshness." He then went on: "Malouf, unlike many poets, is able to find in his past experiences which don't merely illustrate certain established themes but have a specific quality of their own."[3]

Jan Harry in _Poetry Magazine_ found that a number of Malouf's poems "present their world through a steady build up of objects. It is a world that can be seen, felt, heard and consequently one that can be readily entered into...the surface is crowded with small sharp or bright details that create a kind of tapestry weave."[4]
