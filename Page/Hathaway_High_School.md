History

It opened in 1920 in a wooden building on a site that had been acquired from George Hathaway and W. Claude Lamb; it was formed by a merger of the Crochet, Glen Roy, Grand Marais, Nubbin Ridge, and Raymond elementary schools. In 1938-1939 a new steel school building opened, and high school grades opened, with the first graduating class in 1941. A new cafeteria opened in 1945. The school received the twelfth grade in the 1948-1949 school year. A renovation occurred in 1953. In 1975 kindergarten grades opened as they became required under state law. Six more classrooms were installed in 1983. A fire on Sunday, November 26, 1989 destroyed much of the school building, so students temporarily had to attend classes in Lake Arthur while a replacement school building financed by an October 1989 bond was underway. The current building opened in Fall 1992.
