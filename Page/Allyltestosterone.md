ALLYLTESTOSTERONE, or 17Α-ALLYLTESTOSTERONE, also known as 17Α-ALLYLANDROST-4-EN-17Β-OL-3-ONE, is a steroid derived from testosterone that was first synthesized in 1936 and was never marketed.[1][2] Along with propyltestosterone (topterone), it has been patented as a topical antiandrogen and hair growth inhibitor.[3][4] Allyltestosterone is the parent structure of two marketed 19-nortestosterone progestins, allylestrenol and altrenogest.[5] These progestins are unique among testosterone derivatives in that they appear to be associated with few or no androgenic effects.[6][7][8][9]
