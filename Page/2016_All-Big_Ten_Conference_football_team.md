The 2016 ALL-BIG TEN CONFERENCE FOOTBALL TEAM consists of American football players chosen as All-Big Ten Conference players for the 2016 Big Ten Conference football season. The conference recognizes two official All-Big Ten selectors: (1) the Big Ten conference coaches selected separate offensive and defensive units and named first-, second- and third-team players (the "Coaches" team); and (2) a panel of sports writers and broadcasters covering the Big Ten also selected offensive and defensive units and named first-, second- and third-team players (the "Media" team).
