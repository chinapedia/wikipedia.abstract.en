The Empire Strikes Back}} _I AM YOUR FATHER_ is a 2015 Spanish documentary film written and directed by Toni Bestard _(es)_ and Marcos Cabotá _(es)_. The film deals with actor David Prowse many years after he played the role of Darth Vader in the original _Star Wars_ trilogy.[1]


Synopsis

David Prowse is a bodybuilder and actor who famously portrayed the role of Darth Vader in _Star Wars_, _The Empire Strikes Back_, and _Return of the Jedi_. Unlike most of the other _Star Wars_ stars, however, he is relatively obscure, since James Earl Jones dubbed Vader's voice and Sebastian Shaw portrayed an unmasked Vader (in _Return of the Jedi_). Prowse lives anonymously in Croydon, a suburb of London.

The story begins when a young filmmaker travels to London to propose that Prowse reshoot scenes from the trilogy, to prove that Prowse could have played Darth Vader in that particular scene. In a symbolic way, the directors, assisted by a group of enthusiastic fans, will try to give Prowse the recognition he never had.

In this documentary, the directors find some clues about the difficult relationship between Prowse and Lucasfilm, suggesting that the reason for their differences was an article published by a British newspaper during the shooting of _Return of the Jedi_.
