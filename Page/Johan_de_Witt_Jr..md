In 1672, after the murder of his father, his uncle Pieter de Graeff became the guardian of Johann and his siblings. [2] Johan de Witt Jr. later became the overseer of the orphanage in Dordrecht (1684-1685). After that he became secretary (1688-1701) and member of the College of forty (1695) of Dordrecht.

Johan de Witt Jr. married his cousin Wilhelmina de Witt (1671-1701), the daughter of his uncle Cornelis de Witt (1623-1672) en Maria van Berckel (1632-1706). The couple had two children:

-   Johan (1694-1751), who inherited his father's property and sold them in 1723 to Jan Hendrik Strick van Linschoten.
-   Cornelis de Witt (1696-1769), Burgomaster of Dordrecht and Baron of Jaarsveld.
