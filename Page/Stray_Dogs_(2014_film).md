_STRAY DOGS_ () is a 2014 South Korean thriller film starring Kim Jeong-hoon, Cha Ji-heon and Myung Kae-nam. It is co-written and directed by first-time director Ha Won-jun.


Plot

So Yoo-joon (Kim Jeong-hoon) who aspires to be a distinguished reporter is now a third-class reporter. Besides being hounded by vicious loan sharks to pay off his gambling debts, he is also having an affair with Jung-in, the wife of his friend-cum-colleague, who wants to call it quits. Determined to keep her even if he has to kill her husband, he sets out to find him who is on an assignment in an isolated village. While searching for him, his car breaks down and he is stuck at the village.[1]

Although the village seems peaceful, it is hiding a hideous secret â€“ a young woman Kim Eun-hee (Cha Ji-heon), a long time resident, has inadvertently become the sexual plaything for the perverted and pathetic elder village men. When Yoo-joon tries to help Eun-hee, he finds himself on a violent collision course with the locals and the village chief Jang Gi-no (Myung Kae-nam).

Reception

James Mudge: No film that deals with this kind of subject matter should really be guilt-free enjoyment, and with _Wild Dogs_, Ha Won-jun is clearly aiming for hard-edged and challenging. To his credit he largely succeeds, and though not really in the same league as _Moss_ or _Bedevilled_, the film is an effective piece of suspenseful rural nastiness in its own right.[2]

C.J. Wheeler: _Stray Dogs_ is, as best, cynical and stale; and at worst a misogynistic mess ladened with endless exposition and creaky hinges.[3]
