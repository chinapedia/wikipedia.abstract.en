NEGLIGENCE _PER SE_ is a doctrine in US law whereby an act is considered negligent because it violates a statute (or regulation). The doctrine is effectively a form of strict liability.


Elements

In order to prove negligence _per se_, the plaintiff usually must show that:

1.  the defendant violated the statute,
2.  the statute provides for a criminal penalty (i.e., fines or imprisonment) but not for civil penalties,[1]
3.  the act caused the kind of harm the statute was designed to prevent, and
4.  the plaintiff was a member of the statute's protected class.

In some jurisdictions, negligence _per se_ creates merely a rebuttable presumption of negligence.

A typical example is one in which a contractor violates a building code when constructing a house. The house then collapses, injuring somebody. The violation of the building code establishes negligence _per se_ and the contractor will be found liable, so long as the contractor's breach of the code was the cause (proximate cause and actual cause) of the injury.


History

A famous early case in negligence _per se_ is _Gorris v. Scott_ (1874), a Court of Exchequer case that established that the harm in question must be of the kind that the statute was intended to prevent. _Gorris_ involved a shipment of sheep that was washed overboard but would not have been washed overboard had the shipowner complied with the regulations established pursuant to the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act 1869, which required that livestock be transported in pens to segregate potentially-infected animal populations from uninfected ones. Chief Baron Fitzroy Kelly held that as the statute was intended to prevent the spread of disease, rather than the loss of livestock in transit, the plaintiff could not claim negligence _per se_.

A subsequent New York Court of Appeals case, _Martin v. Herzog_ (1920), penned by Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo, first presented the notion that negligence _per se_ could be absolute evidence of negligence in certain cases.


Strict liability

Negligence _per se_ involves the concept of strict liability. Within the law of negligence there has been a move away from strict liability (as typified by _Re Polemis_) to a standard of reasonable care (as seen in _Donoghue v Stevenson_, _The Wagon Mound (No. 1)_, and _Hughes v Lord Advocate_). This is true not just for breach of the common law, but also for breach of statutory duty. The criminal law case of _Sweet v Parsley_ (which required _mens rea_ to be read into a criminal statue) follows this trend. In this light, "negligence _per se_" may be criticised as running counter to the general tendency.
