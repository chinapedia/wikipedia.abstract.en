The ASSUMPTION OF MARY CATHEDRAL [1] () is a Romanian Orthodox church in Baia Mare, Romania.

The cornerstone was laid in 1905, the building completed in 1911. In 1930, the church became the cathedral of the new Romanian Catholic Diocese of Maramure»ô. When the Greek-Catholic Church was outlawed by the communist regime in 1948, the cathedral became a Romanian Orthodox parish. It continues to be used as such, which has led to legal disputes.[2][3]
