THE CHURCH OF SAN JUAN BAUTISTA or Arucas Church, is a catholic temple located on the old town of Arucas, in Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain.

The construction started on 19 March 1909, and took over 68 years to be built. The Church was opened for the public in 1917, but the construction continued until 1977, when the church was completed. Due to the big dimensions, it is usually referred to as _The Arucas cathedral_.
