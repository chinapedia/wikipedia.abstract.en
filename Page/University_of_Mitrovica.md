UNIVERSITETI I MITROVICЁS "ISA BOLETINI" is a public university located in the city of Mitrovica, Kosovo.


History

The foundations of higher education studies in Mitrovica were set with the opening of the Higher Technical School in 1961. In 1970 the Faculty of Engineering opened branches of Mining, Technology and Metallurgy, initially in Mitrovica, school year 1970/71, to continue then in Pristina until the establishment of the Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy in Mitrovica in 1974. Based on the 60 year tradition of higher education in Mitrovica, the Government of the Republic of Kosovo on 06.03.2013 has established the Public University of Mitrovica and the Kosovo Assembly on May 31, 2013 ratified the decision. Based on the 60 year tradition of higher education in Mitrovica, the Government of the Republic of Kosovo on 06.03.2013 has established the Public University of Mitrovica and the Kosovo Assembly on May 31, 2013 ratified the decision. Approved by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, at the University of Mitrovica "Isa Boletini" (UMIB) operate six faculties:[1]

The establishment of the Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy was of great importance for the whole of Kosovo. It was the Trepça-Mineral-Metallurgical Combine that needed great engineering cadres from the Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy. The frameworks from the Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy and the High Technical School are well deserved in the Kosovo Power Combinations and the entire industry and economy of Kosovo.

The students who studied at the Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy and the Technical High School were from all parts of Kosovo, considering that these branches were only studied in Mitrovica. A large number of students came from other Albanian areas, from Macedonia and Presevo, Bujanovac and Medvedja and Montenegro. Many foreign students were enrolled and graduated from this faculty, especially from the Middle East.

Based on these faculties and based on the tradition of over 60 years of higher education in Mitrovica, the Government of the Republic of Kosovo on March 6, 2013, established the Public University of Mitrovica, while the Kosovo Assembly on 31 May 2013 has ratified the decision. According to the Provisional Statute, approved by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, within the University of Mitrovica "Isa Boletini" (UMIB) there are six faculties: Faculty of Geosciences (FGJT), Faculty of Food Technology (FTU), Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Computer Engineering (FIMK), Faculty of Law (FJ), Faculty of Economics (FE) and Faculty of Education (FE).

Within these faculties, there are a total of 23 study programs at bachelor and master level. A total of 69 teachers and assistants in regular working engagement are engaged in the teaching process. Of these, 53 are Doctor of Science and 15 are under a master or master's degree, according to the calls: 15 regular professors, 14 associate professors, 21 assistant professors, 4 lecturers, and 15 assistants.
