Elliott performs Marry the Night while Dani (Demi Lovato) backs him up on the guitar. Kurt turns Elliott down because of the way he was dressed.

When Elliott and the band do appear at Callbacks only one person attends. Later, Kurt comes to Elliott and the band and informs them that their next gig is at a more popular place and then puppets arrive for the band from Blaine Anderson. (Darren Criss).[2]

Reception

John Walker for MTV wrote "Oh my god, Glamberts, sorry we're late -- had to duck out of the hospital before the doctors came back. Oh, wait, you wanna know why we were being treated? Ummm, only because we suffered a flawlessness-induced cardiac arrest to the supremest degree after watching Adam Lambert SLAY his rendition of Lady Gaga's "Marry The Night" on Thursday night's episode of "Glee." Sh-duhhhh, did we really have to spell that one out?"[9] Walker went on to write "His 4-minute performance on "A Katy Or A Gaga" as the character Starchild was literally just, like, one shocker after another."[10] Rae Votta of Billboard wrote "Despite being a pretty straightforward interpretation, his "Marry The Night" trumps the other Gaga number of the episode, but this is also Adam Lambert and he could cover Gaga in his sleep." about Lambert's character performing Marry the Night.[11] In a list comprised by _LA Times_ Adam Lambert is listed as one of their memorable guest stars. The writer wrote "The "American Idol" alum had a five-episode arc during Season 5 as Elliott "Starchild" Gilbert, an NYU student who auditioned for Kurt Hummel's (Chris Colfer) cover band."[12] In _The Celebrity Cafe_'s top 10 Glee guest stars Lambert placed at 7 where the author wrote "If you never watched Glee during the Lambert days, definitely try to because not only does he have the singing chops, but he glams up his outfits like no other and he gives the scruffy look a whole new image which is worth five “woofs.”"[13]
