PIRLANGIMPI is a populated place on Melville Island in the Northern Territory, Australia.[1]

Pirlangimpi lies two kilometres from the site of the first British settlement in northern Australia, the short-lived Fort Dundas. The present settlement, then called Garden Point, was established in 1937 as a police post, because of concerns about the activities of Japanese luggers.[2] In 1940 a mission was founded by the Roman Catholic Missionaries of the Sacred Heart as a home for mixed-blood children, both local part-Japanese and those removed from their families in other parts of the Northern Territory.[3]

Australian Rules football was introduced by Brother John Pye of the Catholic mission.[4] Three Norm Smith Medalists - Maurice Rioli, Michael Long and Cyril Rioli - were raised at the mission at Pirlangimpi.[5]

Marjorie Liddy, who grew up on the mission, provided an image that was widely used in Pope Benedict XVI's visit to World Youth Day 2008 in Sydney.[6]

The present community includes a primary school,[7] police station, small supermarket, club, health facility and airstrip.[8] Our Lady of Victories Catholic Church is the base of the Melville Island parish.[9]

The population is 371 (2011 census).[10]
