History

Harbourside Shopping Centre was opened on 4 May 1988 by Queen Elizabeth II in which she formally opened the Darling Harbour redevelopment as part of the Australian Bicentennial celebrations. Sydney Aquarium was the first attraction to open and was soon followed by a host of museums, shops, restaurants, hotels and bars.[4]

In 2005, Harbourside underwent a full refurbishment which unveiled a new and expanded food court, an entertainment level which is home to a 20-lane Kingpin Bowling Centre, M9 Laser Skirmish and Australia's first Boeing 737-800 flight simulator, Flight Experience.[5]

On 7 November 2013, Harbourside Shopping Centre was acquired by Mirvac for $522 million following the administration of Beville Group which also owns Top Ryde City.[6] Beville Group acquired the centre for $127 million in 2004.[7]


Future

As part of the $3 billion project underway Mirvac planned for a significant new retail shopping centre and commercial office tower," documents, lodged with the Department of Planning and Environment as part of the Harbourside Shopping Centre development in 2015.[8]

However, in August, 2016, Mirvac has dropped plans for an office complex at Darling Harbour and is instead looking to build a taller, skinnier apartment tower as part of its proposed $400 million redevelopment of the Harbourside Shopping Centre.[9]
