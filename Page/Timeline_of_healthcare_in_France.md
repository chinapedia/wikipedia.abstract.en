  Middle Ages    Southern France is one of the leading medical centers in Europe. The University of Montpellier is founded and becomes prominent.[1]
  1770s–1850s    Paris becomes a world center of medical research and teaching. The "Paris School" emphasizes that teaching and research should be based in large hospitals and promotes the professionalization of the medical profession and the emphasis on sanitation and public health.[2]
  1871–1914      The French Third Republic follows behind Bismarckian Germany, as well as Great Britain, in developing the welfare state including public health, accident and old-age insurance.[3]
  1928–2000      From its foundation, the French national health insurance progresses in incremental stages, with big extensions in 1945, 1961, 1966, 1978, and finally in 2000, achieving universal coverage.[4]
  1945 onwards   France develops a universal healthcare system.[5]
  Present        Today, the French healthcare system is one of universal healthcare largely financed by government national health insurance and is regarded among the best in the world. In the last years, there has been an increase in the rate of obesity among the French due mostly to the replacement in eating habits of traditional healthy French cuisine by junk food.[6]
