Star_Trek_costume_-_Romulan.jpg The ROMULANS () are a fictional extraterrestrial species in the American science fiction franchise _Star Trek_. They first appeared in the series _Star Trek_ in 1966. As well as featuring in three episodes of that series, they were later used in the television series _The Animated Series_, _The Next Generation_, _Deep Space Nine_, _Voyager_, and _Enterprise_, as well as the feature films _Star Trek: Nemesis_ (2002) and _Star Trek_ (2009). They also appear in various other spin-off media, including books and games.

The writer Paul Schneider created the Romulans for use in the 1966 _Star Trek_ episode "Balance of Terror". As a basis, he considered what the ancient Roman Empire might have looked like had it developed to the point of spaceflight. Physically, the Romulans were presented as humanoid, but the show's make-up department gave them pointed ears to distinguish them from humans. In the series, which is set in the 23rd century, the Romulans were presented as having split from another alien species, the Vulcans, in the distant past. In contrast to the Vulcans, who were presented as peaceful and logic-oriented, the Romulans were depicted as militaristic, having founded an interstellar empire. The Romulans were used as antagonists for the series' protagonists, the Earth ship USS _Enterprise_, and as being in a hostile relationship to the United Federation of Planets, of which Earth was presented as a prominent member.

In 1987, the writers of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_—set in the 24th century—again introduced the Romulans as antagonists of the Federation. The show's designers gave the Romulans new costumes and added a V-shaped ridge on their foreheads. The writers of _Deep Space Nine_ again included the Romulans, but presented them as allies of the Federation in the Dominion War of 2373 to 2375. In the film _Star Trek: Nemesis_, control of the Romulan Empire is presented as having been temporarily secured by one of its conquered species, the Remans. The 2009 film _Star Trek_ depicted the Romulan homeworld, Romulus, being destroyed by a supernova in the year 2387; again, the film's designers altered the appearance of the Romulans, removing the V-shaped ridges. The impact of Romulus' destruction forms a plot-theme in the forthcoming _Star Trek Picard_.


History

Original development

The Romulans were devised for the episode "Balance of Terror". In 2014, "Balance of Terror" was rated the best episode in the franchise by Io9.[1]

The Romulans were reused for the second season episode "The Deadly Years" and the third season episode "The Enterprise Incident".

Reintroduction in the 1980s and 1990s

After the launch of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ in 1987, the show's writers introduced the Romulans in the final episode of the first season, "The Neutral Zone", which aired in the U.S. in May 1988. The episode was written by Maurice Hurley, who later acknowledged rushing it, putting together a script in a day and a half. In the episode, which is set in the year 2364, the Starfleet ship USS _Enterprise_-D—whose crew are the series' main protagonists—responds to the disappearance of Federation colonies along the Neutral Zone, fearing that it reflects growing Romulan activity in the region. Investigating, the _Enterprise_ crew encounter a Romulan spaceship; it is stated that this is the first encounter between the two peoples for 53 years. The Romulans reveal that they have had colonies destroyed on their side of the border too, and the two species agree to share information on the issue in future. In later episodes it is revealed that these colonies were destroyed by a previously unknown species, the Borg, whom the show's writers had devised as a new alien antagonist following dissatisfaction with their previous attempt, the Ferengi. Initial thoughts by the script-writers had proposed a multi-episode storyline in which the Federation and Romulan governments would co-operate to fight the Borg; ultimately only certain elements of this idea entered "The Neutral Zone" and the Borg would be introduced not in the first season, but in the second season episode "Q Who".

New costumes were designed for the actors playing Romulans, created by the show's costume designer William Theiss. The newly designed Romulan ship that appeared in "The Neutral Zone" was built as a miniature model by Greg Jein. The ship featured a newly-designed Romulan crest, featuring a stylised bird of prey clutching two planets, Romulus and Remus, in its claws. Later in the series, this ship type would be explicitly referred to as a "warbird". In 1989, AMT released a plastic kit of the vessel, alongside other kits for a Ferengi ship and a Klingon bird of prey vessel.

The Romulans were re-used for the second season episode "Contagion", written by Steve Gerber and Beth Woods and first aired in March 1989. In this episode, the _Enterprise_-D entered the Neutral Zone to answer a distress call and ends up in conflict with a Romulan vessel, with both spaceships being disabled by an alien computer virus. "Contagion" was the first episode in the _Star Trek_ franchise in which the Romulan ship was given a name, in this case the Haakona. In the third season episode "The Enemy", written by David Kemper and Michael Piller and first screened in November 1989, the _Enterprise_-D is depicted rescuing a crashed Romulan ship. The episode introduced the Romulan character Tomalak, played by Andreas Katsulas, who would reappear in three further _Next Generation_ episodes. It also further established the idea of a significant enmity between the Romulans and the Klingons, with the _Enterprise_'s Klingon officer, Worf (Michael Dorn), refusing to donate blood to save the life of an injured Romulan; the scriptwriters had debated whether to include this, with Dorn initially reticent.

Three episodes later, in "The Defector", written by Ronald D. Moore and first screened in January 1990, a Romulan admiral is presented as seeking to defect to the Federation. The episode is the first in the franchise to include images of Romulus itself and introduced the design of a Romulan scout vessel. "The Defector" also includes a reference to the Battle of Cheron, an incident in the 22nd century Earth-Romulan War that was previously mentioned in "Balance of Terror".

_Deep Space Nine_ and _Voyager_

For "The Search", the opening two-part episode of the third season of _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, a Romulan link was introduced. The episode, which was written by Ira Steven Behr, Robert Hewitt Wolfe, and Ronald D. Moore, featured the introduction of a new Starfleet ship, the USS _Defiant_; the scriptwriters included the idea that it had been equipped with a cloaking device by the Romulans in return for intelligence that the Federation gathered on another alien power, the Dominion. A Romulan character, T'Rul (Martha Hackett), was included to oversee the device's use aboard the _Defiant_. The show's writers had initially planned on including T'Rul as a permanent fixture on the show but decided that she did not offer enough potential for new storylines.

The Romulans were reused later that season in "Visionary", where they are presented as attempting to destroy the Deep Space Nine space station as part of their plan to collapse the nearby wormhole and thus prevent a Dominion invasion of the Alpha Quadrant, the region of space where both the Federation and Romulans reside. Three episodes later, the follow-on episodes "Improbable Cause" and "The Die Is Cast" again featured the Romulans, in this case portraying a joint mission by the Romulan Tal Shiar and Cardassian Obsidian Order to fatally cripple the Dominion by eradicating its leaders, the Founders. For these episodes, new Tal Shiar outfits were designed; Moore related that this was partly his decision, for he "hated, underline hated, the Romulan costumes [introduced in the first season of _The Next Generation_]. Big shoulder pads, the quilting, I just loathed it." Costume designer Robert Blackman noted that his team created eight new Romulan uniforms, using the same fabric as the old ones but "dyed it down slightly, and we made them much sleeker and a little more menacing".

Reboot: 2009–

Nero_from_Star_Trek.jpg

After _Star Trek: Nemesis_ proved a financial failure and _Star Trek: Enterprise_ was cancelled, the franchise's executive producer Rick Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendresen began developing a new film entitled _Star Trek: The Beginning_, which was to be set during the 22nd century Earth-Romulan War. The project never materialised.[2] Instead, the decision was made to reboot the series by creating a film using the characters of the original _Star Trek_ series but played by new actors. Putting together a script for the new film, the director J. J. Abrams stated that he wanted Romulans to be the antagonists because they had featured less than the Klingons in the original _Star Trek_ series.[3] The film's writers, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, thought that it would feel backward to demonize the Klingons as villains again after they had been presented heroically in later _Star Trek_ series; they also wanted to use Spock as a central character in the film and believed that the Romulan presence would continue Spock's story from his last chronological appearance in "Unification".[4]

In the reboot film, titled _Star Trek_ and released in 2009, the planet Romulus is destroyed by a supernova in the year 2387. A Romulan mining ship, the _Narada_, survives and travels back in time to the 23rd century; its commander, Nero (Eric Bana), is committed to destroying the planet Vulcan to punish Spock for failing to save Romulus. The actors playing Romulans in this film wore three prosthetics applied to their ears and foreheads, while Bana had a fourth prosthetic for the bitemark on his ear that extends to the back of his character's head.[5] The film's Romulans lacked the 'V'-shaped ridges on the foreheads, which had been present in all of their depictions outside the original series. Neville Page wanted to honor that by having Nero's crew ritually scar themselves too, forming keloids reminiscent of the 'V'-ridges. It was abandoned as they did not pursue the idea enough.[6]

According to sources involved in the production of _Star Trek: Picard_, the forthcoming series features the character of Jean-Luc Picard deeply affected by the destruction of Romulus.[7]


Books

The Romulans have been the focus of a number of books, and have appeared or been mentioned in many others. Among their key appearances have been:

-   Diane Duane's miniseries _Star Trek: Rihannsu_, consisting to-date of five books written between 1984 and 2006, is regarded as one of deepest works focusing on the Romulans.
-   In Dalla Van Hise's _Killing Time_ (1985), the Romulans use time travel to alter history, which results in James T. Kirk becoming an ensign and Spock a starship captain.
-   A prototype Romulan warbird is the focus of Simon Hawke's novel _The Romulan Prize_ (1993).
-   Robert Greenberger's _The Romulan Stratagem_ (1995) involves Jean-Luc Picard and his crew competing with the Romulan officer Sela to convince a planet to join their respective states.
-   In Diane Carey's _Red Sector_ (1999), Spock and Leonard McCoy try to cure a virus that has infected the Romulan royal family.
-   Josepha Sherman and Susan M. Schwartz's _Vulcan's Heart_ (1999) involved Spock traveling to Romulus to aid the Romulan Commander from "The _Enterprise_ Incident".
-   _Captain's Blood_ (2003), one of many collaborative works between _Star Trek_ lead William Shatner and husband-and-wife team Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, focused on the involvement of Kirk in preventing a Romulan civil war in the aftermath of _Star Trek: Nemesis_.
-   The Tomed Incident is the focus of David R. George III's novel _Serpents Among the Ruins_ (2003), which featured the crew of the _Enterprise-B_.
-   _Star Trek: Vulcan's Soul_ is a trilogy written by Sherman and Shwartz between 2004 and 2007; set in the aftermath of the Dominion War, it focuses on members of Kirk's original crew becoming involved in a war between the Romulans and a fellow Vulcan offshoot, the Watraii.
-   In _Star Trek: Titan_ premier _Taking Wing_ (2005), the Romulan Star Empire collapses into civil war in the wake of _Star Trek: Nemesis_.
-   The _Star Trek: Titan_ novel _The Red King_ (2005) opens with the disappearance of a Romulan fleet and features Donatra, the Romulan commander featured in _Star Trek: Nemesis_, working alongside William Riker and his crew.
-   In the novel _Kobayashi Maru_ (2008) by Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangels, Admiral Valdore attempts once again to cause conflict in the region approximately one year after the incident involving the Aenar, this time using a "telecapture" system, designed to take over and control enemy ships. Using three Klingon vessels, Valdore attacks Coalition of Planets allies hoping to weaken or destroy two enemies of the Romulan Star Empire by provoking a war. Captain Archer is eventually able to provide evidence of this Romulan deception. This is followed by yet another unsuccessful attempt to break apart the alliance which involves using telecaptured Vulcan cruisers against Proxima Centauri (a recent coalition member). In the book, the event that finally sparks the Coalition's declaration of war against the Romulans is the destruction of the Earth freighter _Kobayashi Maru_.
-   The sequel to the novel _Kobayashi Maru_ is titled _The Romulan War: Beneath the Raptor's Wing_ by Michael A. Martin. It is set between July 22, 2155 and July 22, 2156, and details the war between the Coalition of planets and the Romulan Star Empire. The story focuses on the Romulan attempts at taking over the Coalition whilst the Vulcans who are aware they are vulnerable to the telecapture weapon withdraw from the fight early. The other Coalition members withdraw one by one in the face of continued losses, leaving it up to Earth Starfleet to stop the Romulan menace.
