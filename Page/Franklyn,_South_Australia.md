FRANKLYN is a rural locality in the Mid North region of South Australia, situated in the Regional Council of Goyder.[1] It was established in August 2000, when boundaries were formalised for the "long established local name". It comprises the northern section of the cadastral Hundred of Wonna.[2] The name stems from a Franklyn House in Devonshire.[3]

Franklyn was surveyed as a government town in May 1880, but the town was formally declared to have ceased to exist on 9 February 1984.[4] Franklyn Post Office opened on 1 October 1883, was downgraded to a receiving office in January 1910, and closed on 9 July 1917.[5] A second post office, Pandappa Dam, operated in the south-east of the locality from 1 April 1883 until around 1908.[6][7] A school opened under the name of Wonna in 1883, was renamed Franklyn in 1886, and closed in 1916, while Pandappa Dam School opened in 1893 and closed in 1898.[8][9]

In October 1908, a correspondent to _The Chronicle_ in Adelaide wrote that "there used to be a lot of people living here, but [...] it is very lonely now. There are only about a dozen families here, mostly farmers [...] and dairymen. We have a school and a church, however, so that we are not total barbarians. We also have a post-office, although we have only one mail a week."[10] In 1916, it was proposed to rename the town Wonna to avoid confusion with "Franklin", a subdivision in what is now the Adelaide suburb of Pennington, but this did not occur.[11][12]

The 1051-hectare Pandappa Conservation Park is located entirely within Franklyn.[13][14]

The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Franklyn had seven people living within its boundaries.[15]
