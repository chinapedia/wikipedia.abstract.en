History

Nordea is the result of the successive mergers and acquisitions of the Swedish, Finnish, Danish and Norwegian banks of Nordbanken, Merita Bank, Unibank and Kreditkassen (Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse) that took place between 1997 and 2000.

PK-banken was formed in 1974 by a merger between Postbanken (formed 1884) and Sveriges Kreditbank (formed 1923), both state-owned.

The private Nordbanken was formed in 1986 by a merger of two smaller private local banks, Uplandsbanken and Sundsvallsbanken. The Swedish banking crisis of 1991, resulting from deregulated markets and a housing price bubble, forced the government to nationalise Nordbanken for 64 billion kronor. Bad debts were transferred to the asset-management companies Securum and Retriva, which sold off the assets.

The name Nordea comes from the Swedish bank Nordbanken; this developed from PK-banken (Post och Kreditbanken) which in 1990 purchased the smaller private bank Nordbanken, and picked up that name. The name is also a contraction of the words NORdic and iDEAs.[5]

Merita Bank was a 1995 merger of the former main rivals in Finland, the originally Svecoman Union Bank of Finland (Suomen Yhdyspankki) founded in 1842 and the Fennoman National Share Bank (Kansallis-Osake-Pankki) founded in 1889.

In August 2017, DNB ASA and Nordea combined their operations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to create Luminor Bank.[6]

Online theft

Nordea was the subject of an online phishing scam in 2007. The amount of money involved was "between seven and eight million SEK".[8] The theft was perpetrated by targeting Nordea customers with phishing emails containing a trojan horse, that was especially made for this robbery. Apparently these emails were sent out over a period of 15 months. According to Nordea, at least 250 people had unwittingly installed the trojan. The thieves evaded detection by limiting their transfers to small sums. Nordea refunded all the victims and has implemented a new security system, Chip Authentication Program[9]


Panama document leak

The largest financial group in the Nordic region, Nordea has, despite warnings from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FI) been active in using offshore companies in tax havens according to the Panama papers.[10]

The Nordea section in Luxembourg, between the years 2004 and 2014, founded nearly 400 offshore companies in Panama and the British Virgin Islands for its customers.[11]

The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FI) has pointed out that there are "serious deficiencies" in how Nordea monitors money laundering, and has given the bank two warnings. In 2015, Nordea had to pay the largest possible fine - over 5 million EUR.[12]

In 2012, Nordea asked Mossack Fonseca to change documents retroactively so that three Danish customers power of attorney documents had been in force since 2010.[13]

The director for Nordea Private banking Thorben Sanders admits that before 2009 they did not screen for customers that tried to evade tax. "At the end of 2009 we decided that our bank should not be a means of tax evasion" says Thorben Sanders. [14]

As a consequence of the leaked documents, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FI) stated on 4 April 2016 that it had started an investigation into the conduct of Nordea, the largest financial group in the Nordic region. The Swedish minister of Finance Magdalena Andersson characterized the conduct of Nordea as "a crime" and "totally unacceptable".[15][16] Nordea CEO Casper von Koskull stated that he was disappointed with the shortcomings within Nordea's operating principles, saying that "this cannot be tolerated".[17]

Other Swedish banks are mentioned in the documents, but mention of Nordea occurs 10,902 times and the second-most mentioned bank has 764 matches.[18]

Stefan Löfven, Prime Minister of Sweden, said in 2016 that he was very critical of the conduct of Nordea and its role, and said "Â- They are on the list of shame too".[19]


Tax evasion and the Paradise Papers

Nordea bank loaned billions of euros to shipping companies that own vessels in secrecy jurisdictions such as Bermuda, Cyprus, Panama, BVI, the Cayman Islands and the Isle of Man. In the Paradise Papers, Nordea was shown to have lent a significant amount of money to customers based in tax havens.[20]


Drug money laundering

Nordea was involved in the laundering of drug money in Denmark, by allowing withdrawal of 500 euro note bills despite the Danish police advising against this.[21] Nordea has admitted its involvement in the money laundering, and has claimed it has stopped these activities.[22]
