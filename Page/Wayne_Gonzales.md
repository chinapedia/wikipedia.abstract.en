WAYNE GONZALES (born 1957 in New Orleans, Louisiana) is a New York-based American painter whose work confronts the conversations between photography, history, and memory.[1]


Education

Gonzales earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of New Orleans in 1985.[2]


Work

Gonzales' paintings depict scenes of American Culture by using sources of imagery often taken from mass media and the internet.[3] He uses factual components to find instinctive connections to abstraction through painting. Up close, the paintings appear pixelated; once glanced from a far the pixelation comes together and forms an intricate image.[4] Gonzales became well known for presenting socially and political imagery, such as his paintings based around the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This body of work gained much acknowledgement when it opened at Paula Cooper Gallery in 2001.[5][6] His work has traveled to galleries and museums across the world where he has exhibited in group and solo shows. Notably he has collections with the Guggenheim Museum and Paula Cooper Gallery in New York.
