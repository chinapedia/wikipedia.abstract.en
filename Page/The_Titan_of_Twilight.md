Reception

Gideon Kibblewhite reviewed _The Titan of Twilight_ for _Arcane_ magazine, rating it a 6 out of 10 overall.[2] He calls the novel "An enjoyable romp" noting that "The body count is extraordinarily high, with expendable soldiers and leading characters on all sides meeting all manner of gruesome deaths. Indeed, this is one of the book's strengths. The story begins with a vicious battle and thereafter a steady shower of lopped limbs keeps things ticking along nicely."[3] He comments that "Troy Denning has great fun dishing up a variety of tricky problems and hideous monsters for our heroes to tackle as events roll towards a stunning finale where the legendary titan himself makes an appearance."[4] Kibblewhite concludes the review by saying "Not one for the faint-hearted (you'll never win a fair lady either) but for the rest of us an above-average read."[5]
