Founded in Buffalo, New York in 1998, Every Time I Die was formed by vocalist Keith Buckley, guitarists Jordan Buckley (Keith's brother) and Andy Williams, bassist John McCarthy and drummer Mike "Ratboy" Novak.[1] After releasing EP _The Burial Plot Bidding War_ in 2000, the band replaced McCarthy with Aaron Ratajczak and released its debut full-length album _Last Night in Town_ on Ferret Music in 2001.[2] Stephen Micciche became the group's third bassist in 2001, performing on the band's second album _Hot Damn!_ released in 2003.[3]

Micciche left in 2005 and was briefly replaced by Kevin Falk, who performed on the band's third album _Gutter Phenomenon_.[4] The 2005 release reached number 71 on the US _Billboard_ 200.[5] Chris Byrnes took Falk's place later in the year, who was later substituted for Keller Harbin for touring.[6] The band released its first video album _Shit Happens: The Life. The Stage. The Road. The DVD._ in 2006.[7] The group's fourth album (and their final release on Ferret Music), _The Big Dirty_, was released in 2007 and reached number 41 on the _Billboard_ 200,[8] as well as entering the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart at number five.UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart peak positions for Every Time I Die studio albums:

After signing with Epitaph Records earlier in the year, Every Time I Die released fifth album _New Junk Aesthetic_ in September 2009, which again reached the top 50 of the _Billboard_ 200.[10] Shortly before the album's release, Novak left the band and was replaced by Ryan "Legs" Leger.[11][12] The following year the band released its second video _Shit Happens: The Series?_, which features a series of web episodes and additional footage.[13] _Ex Lives_ followed in 2012, topping the _Billboard_ Hard Rock Albums and UK Rock & Metal Albums charts.[14][15] Micciche returned to the band for a second stint shortly before the album's release.[16] 2014's _From Parts Unknown_ reached number 22 on the _Billboard_ 200.[17]
