_GODWEENSATAN LIVE_ is Ween's seventh live album. It was released on November 18, 2016 on Chocodog Records.

This album is a 2-disc chronicling of a performance from September 14, 2001 in which Ween played their first album, _"GodWeenSatan: The Oneness"_, in its entirety, for its 11th (advertised as 25th) anniversary re-release. The show almost did not happen due to the 9/11 terrorist attacks that had taken place three days prior.
