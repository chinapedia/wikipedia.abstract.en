It has rough fibrous bark near the base and smooth greyish and orange to bronze bark higher up. It has lance-shaped leaves, yellow or creamy flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, white flowers and hemispherical fruit with strongly raised valves.Eucalyptus_ammophila_foliage.jpg


Description

_Eucalyptus ammophila_ is a mallee that grows to high, rarely a small, multistemmed tree, and forms a lignotuber. The trunk has rough, fibrous, greyish brown bark and the upper parts of the trunk and the branches have smooth greyish and orange to bronze-coloured bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have square stems and broad lance-shaped to egg-shaped leaves that are long and wide with a short petiole. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, long and wide with a petiole long. Both sides of the leaf are the same dull green, although bluish green at first.[2][3]

The flowers are arranged in groups of between seven and eleven in leaf axils on a peduncle long, each flower on a pedicel about long. The mature flower buds are oval to spindle-shaped, yellow or cream-coloured, long and about wide. The operculum is cone-shaped and about long. The fruit is a hemispherical capsule long and wide with the four, sometimes five, strongly raised valves.[4][5]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus ammophila_ was first formally described in 1994 by Ian Brooker and Andrew Slee from a specimen collected in the Maranoa region of Queensland, and the description was published in the journal _Austrobaileya_.[6][7] The specific epithet (_ammophila_) is from the Ancient Greek words _ammos_ meaning "sand"[8] and _philos_, meaning "dear one" or "friend"[9] referring to this species' preference for growing on sandplains.[10]


Distribution and habitat

The sandplain red gum grows on red or orange sandplains in central and southern Queensland, including areas near Charleville, Yalleroi Jericho and the White Mountains.[11]
