DUNCAN PARSONS (born 25 October 1971) is a British drummer and singer/songwriter. He grew up in the South of England, attending The Skinners' School in Tunbridge Wells.

Although his primary instrument is drums, he also plays guitar, bass, mandolin and keyboards, and is a sound engineer/producer.

He is also a programmer, working with GForce.[1]


In the 1990s

Duncan's music career started with school and university bands. After having been drumming for a number of years, in 1993 he received some tuition from Bill Bruford.[2]

His early recorded work was with Marc Catley,[3] with whom he recorded three full albums, and a number of contributions to other albums between 1993 and 1996.[4] Two of the albums (_Hot Air For Jesus_ and _No Tomorrow_) were Christian satirical music, later combined into the release _Char_; the other (as Paley's Watch) was the progressive rock album _November_, released in 1994, featuring singer Marianne Velvart.[5][6][7]

Later in the 1990s Duncan worked with various artists, including film-maker Philip Clemo,[8] Marianne Velvart's band, and folk singer Judith Silver.


Solo work

From the late 1990s through to the early 2010s, Duncan largely withdrew from public involvement with music, until the release of _Abandoned Buildings_ in 2012, a collection of 18 tracks described as "a song cycle with an emotional arc telling of grace against a backdrop of falling in love and failing in love."[9] This was followed by another, more progressive album _C:Ore_ in 2014. Whilst Duncan plays the majority of the instruments on these albums, they also have featured guest appearances from John Hackett, Steve Hackett, Gary Boyle, Raul D'Oliveira, Ton Scherpenzeel, and Daughters Of Davis.[10]

Alongside these larger scale releases, Parsons has also released two pseudo ambient albums under the banner _Music for Stairlifts_, _Vol.1_ and _Vol.2: (Adapting Silent Films) For The Radio_.[11]

When performing live, Duncan normally sings accompanying himself on a nylon strung guitar (carrying on in the tradition of Marc Catley's _Classical Acoustic Rock_). He performs arrangements of his own works from solo albums, as well as songs by Supertramp, King Crimson, Family, Chaka Khan, Jethro Tull, The Moody Blues, and others.


Video

In support of _Abandoned Buildings_, Parsons drew an animated film to accompany the album. Ten of the eighteen album tracks were used in full (along with an instrumental excerpt from the track _Answerphone_) to create a 45-minute animated cartoon, following the same emotional arc as the album. A DVD was released, _The Abandoned Buildings Cinema Show_, shortly after the CD. This included a bonus feature of an additional animation for the instrumental track _Tumbl√© d'Amour_.[12]

Further animation and video has followed for _Music for Stairlifts_ and _C:Ore_ of varying quality. Examples of his work are available on YouTube.[13]


Production work

In 1995, Duncan produced a three song demo for Marianne Velvart. This generated interest from Rick Wakeman, leading to Marianne being signed to Wakeman's _Hope_ label. The label folded before Marianne recorded a note.[14]

As well as helping local Sheffield musicians with demos and album projects, in 2011 Duncan started collaborating with John Hackett, aiding him with production on four albums released through his HackTrax label; two duet albums with classical guitarist Nick Fletcher, _Overnight Snow_ and _Hills Of Andalucia_, and two of Nick's solo albums, _A Moment Of Stars_ and _Blue Horizon_.[15]


John Hackett Band

Following the release of John Hackett's _Another Life_, a trio was formed with John (guitars, keys, vocals), Nick Fletcher (lead guitar) and Duncan (percussion, vocals), which was soon expanded to a full band with the addition of Jeremy Richardson (bass, guitars, vocals) and Duncan moving to full drum kit.

The band started public performances as the John Hackett Band in 2016, their debut album _We Are Not Alone_ was released in 2017 through Esoteric Antenna Records as a double CD set of a studio album and a live album recorded in 2016.[16]
