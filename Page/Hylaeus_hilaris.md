_HYLAEUS HILARIS_ is a species of bee, also known by the common name HILARIS YELLOW-FACED BEE.[1] It is endemic to Hawaii and known only from a single population.[2] In September 2016, along with six other Hawaiian _Hylaeus_ species,[3] _H. hilaris_ was listed for protection under the United States Endangered Species Act. This marked a first listing for any bee species in the US.[4]


Description

_Hylaeus hilaris_ is large relative to other coastal Hawaiian _Hylaeus_ species. Males have an almost completely yellow face with other yellow markings on the body and wings of smoky coloring. Their metasoma is red. Females have some brown markings.[5]


Distribution and habitat

_Hylaeus hilaris_ is now known only from a single population (of unknown size) in the coastal shrublands of the Moomomi Preserve on Molokai. Threats to the species include habitat degradation by nonnative animals and plants, predation by nonnative insects, fires and climate change.[6]
