-   ANIME MUSIC VIDEOS/MADS – A staple of anime conventions both in Japan and Western countries, these fan-made videos take footage from various anime works and re-edit them in different order, addition of new soundtracks (including to full-length songs), and other manipulations such as lip-syncing characters to lyrics; with the propagation of the Internet and popularity of anime in the United States in 2003, this type of user-created content flourished, and grew to include footage from other works including video games and Western animated shows.[215][216]
-   80'S REMIX – A series of videos where contemporary pop music is reinterpreted as songs released during the 1980s.[217][218]
-   SERGEY STEPANOV, aka EPIC SAX GUY – A Moldovan musician who quickly gained Internet attention after performing in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 as part of the SunStroke Project. The performance of Stepanov miming a saxophone solo of Moldova's entry[219] has been remixed and looped for ten hours. The group have embraced the Internet attention and has mentioned 'Epic Sax Guy' in some of their singles, including a single called 'Epic Sax'. In the 2017 contest, SunStroke Project returned with Stepanov, who later played the famous riff live during an interview.[220]
-   HURRA TORPEDO – A Norwegian band whose coast-to-coast tour was a viral campaign to promote the Ford Fusion car.[221]
-   LUCIAN PIANE, aka REVOLUCIAN – Created several popular celebrity techno remixes, including a spoof on actor Christian Bale titled "Bale Out"[222]
-   LITERAL MUSIC VIDEO – Covers of music videos where the original lyrics have been replaced with ones that literally describe the events that occur in the video, typically disconnected with the original lyrics of the song.[223][224]
-   NIGHTCORE - A type of music that started as a subgenre of trance and is still considered so by many people. Nightcore is characterized by a sped-up melody (sometimes), fast rhythmic beat (usually), and always higher than normal pitch. Almost all nightcore music are original songs nightcored (remixed into nightcore) by nightcore fans. Nightcore was introduced in 2002 and began its spread to the internet in mid 2005.[225]
-   "PINK SEASON" - An album by artist and YouTube personality Filthy Frank, under his "Pink Guy" persona. The album consists of various tracks that are often overly vulgar and comedic. The album went viral on its release and soared to the top of the iTunes charts.[226]
-   RICKROLLING – A phenomenon involving posting a URL in an Internet forum that appears to be relevant to the topic at hand, but is, in fact, a link to a video of Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up". The practice originated on 4chan as a "Duckroll", in which an image of a duck on wheels was what was linked to. The practice of Rickrolling became popular after April Fools' Day in 2008 when YouTube rigged every feature video on its home page to Rick Astley's song.[227][228]
-   MASHA BABKO RICKROLLING is a variation of the former originated in 4chan and other popular Russian imageboards and social media websites. The Masha Babko rickrolling represents an interesting twist in the understanding of internet crowds and the prevalence and evolution of mobbing patterns. It involves Masha Babko a Russian model and internet celebrity, former victim of sexual abuse whose exploits became somehow viral, on the clip Masha performs during some candid scenes of one of her infamous videos, build some expectations and cuts anticlimatically to Rick Astley's famous song. To a certain extent and for some time Russian youngsters have been using this theme to harass either Masha or any other person whose behaviour is deemed worth of social harassment. From there it has evolved to become also an implicit warning for kids and internet media figures that may end up involved in similar circumstances. Finally and by cheer and unopposed reiteration it has become also a symbol of superation of difficulties for youngsters in difficult situations.[229]
-   "SANDSTORM" – A phenomenon which involves answering a question about song's name. For example, in the comments of a YouTube video with Darude's 1999 song Sandstorm, no matter what the song in the video is.[230]
-   "YOU REPOSTED IN THE WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD" – A remix by SHOKK 青 of Shake That by Eminem featuring Nate Dogg and Casin by glue70. The song went viral when the remixes' instrumental was put to other songs.[231]
-   009 SOUND SYSTEM - An electronic music project by Alexander Perls that gained popularity on YouTube after its implementation of the AudioSwap system on the website, which replaced copyrighted music with a Creative Commons licensed track. Since the track names were in alphabetical sorting, 009 Sound System tracks were first on the list, which made them the most used ones. Most popular tracks were "With a Spirit", "Dreamscape", "Holy Ghost", "Space and Time" and others. During the AudioSwap era of YouTube, users reacted negatively to these songs being very frequent on the site, but in YouTube's later days, "With a Spirit" became the site's unofficial anthem, as deemed by users. It's an important aspect when referring to YouTube's Golden Era, along with low-resolution, low-framerate desktop capture videos (usually captured with the unregistered version of the software HyperCam 2), Club Penguin tutorials, mostly about hacking the game's currency, with the tutorial steps being written in Notepad, footage edited with Windows Movie Maker (usually using poor grammar and loudly colored characters in different fonts) and clickbait titles among others.[232]
