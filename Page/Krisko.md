KRISTIAN TALEV (, born 11 May 1988) better known by his stage name KRISKO (), is a Bulgarian recording artist, songwriter, producer and entrepreneur. He is signed to the Bulgarian record label Facing The Sun Records and is also co-owner of the label Adamand Records.


Early life

Kristian Talev was born on May 11, 1988 in the Bulgarian capital Sofia. Having spent most of his childhood in Gabrovo, his interest in music stems from his family and relatives, who inspired him to pursue a serious involvement in music. His career started from an early age by participating in notable Bulgarian children TV shows such as _Bon-Bon_ and _Koi e po po nai_. In the follow-up years, he adopted the stage name Krisko and began writing his own songs.[1]


Career

2005–2011: Early career

Krisko started to write his own songs in 2005, being part of a neighborhood group. Later he started studying sound engineering and in 2008 he worked as a sound engineer in Radio 1 Bulgaria. From 2009 to 2010 he was briefly signed to Bulgarian rapper Spens's CCCP (Sam Sam Si Records) label as a producer and performer. Together they recorded the song _Neka Sam Sam_ and in 2010 he made his breakthrough with the single _Ludo Noshti_ featuring Bulgarian Eurovision performer Elitsa Todorova.

2011–2016: Breakthrough of Krisko Beats

Following a dispute with Spens in 2011, Krisko left his label and adopted the production tag "Krisko Beats". Subsequently, he was one of the first artists signed to the newly founded Bulgarian record label _Facing The Sun_ both as a performer and a producer.

Kriskо's projects _Slagam Krai_ with Nevena and Miro, _Koi Den Stanahme_ with Angel & Moisei, _Ministara na Veselieto_ featuring Bobo and Lora Karadzhova, _Vidimo Dovolni_ with Maria Ilieva, _Zlatnite Momcheta_ featuring Dim4ou and a feature in Gery-Nikol's debut single _Ela i si Vzemi_ all gained exceptional positions in the Bulgarian Music Charts. Moreover, the Council for Electronic Media of Bulgaria considered the song _Vidimo Dovolni_ after a lot of signals about the censorship of the song.[2]

In 2015, Krisko became part of the 4th season of X Factor Bulgaria, where he mentored the female singers.[3] Darina Yotova from his team made it through the finals. Under Krisko's mentorship she started performing under the stage name Dara and was later signed to Virginia Records.[4]

2016–present: New projects and Adamand Records

On April 20, 2016 Krisko announced the single _Dali Tova Lyubov e_ citing it as "a bit different project from his other songs with a love theme". The video was recorded in Bali, Indonesia featuring a local Indonesian model as his love interest.[5] In September 2016, Krisko premiered the song _#OET_, known as _Oshte Edin Tants_, which was also highlighted with a romantic thematic. The video of the song was filmed in Dubai, United Arab Emirates together with his girlfriend Tsvetelina Todorova.[6]

On September 8, 2016 Krisko announced the establishment of his own record label under the name of Adamand Records in a joint effort with Bulgarian film producer Kiril Kirov.[7]

On October 6, 2016, Krisko was featured on Bulgarian singer Tita's debut single "Voodoo Kukla". She also became the first performer to be signed to Krisko's label Adamand Records.[8]
