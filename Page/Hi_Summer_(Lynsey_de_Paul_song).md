"HI SUMMER" is a song written by Lynsey de Paul and recorded by Carl Wayne as a single released on the DJM/Weekend label in 1977.[1][2][3] The B-side of the single is another song composed by de Paul, "My Girl and Me".[4][5][6] Both songs were produced by de Paul. It was used as the theme tune to the popular Saturday night prime time ITV variety programme _Hi Summer_, which also featured Carl Wayne as one of the performers.[7] The song received good reviews, with notable British DJ and music critic James Hamilton[8] writing "Ultra-brite and bouncy TV theme really does get â€˜em jiving" for his weekly disco music feature in _Record Mirror_.[9] That issue of Record Mirror also contained a half page advert for the single.[10]

Although it did not reach the UK Singles Chart, in part due to lack of BBC radio play, it peaked at a respectable number 4 on the official Rhodesian singles chart,[11] and made number 10 in the South African chart,[12] having been released on the Gallo label.[13]

Later, the song was also used to advertise ITV's weekly magazine _TVTimes_ and its affiliated regional commercial television channels,. "Hi Summer" was also included as an album track on the 1977 compilation album, _T.V. Themes_, released on the DJM/Weekend Records label.[14] It receives occasional air play in the U.S.[15][16][17]
