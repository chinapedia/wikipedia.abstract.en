VINYLTESTOSTERONE (also known as 17Α-VINYLTESTOSTERONE, 17Α-VINYLANDROST-4-EN-17Β-OL-3-ONE, and 17Α-HYDROXYPREGNA-4,20-DIEN-3-ONE) is a synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) that was never marketed.[1][2] However, two 19-nortestosterone derivatives of vinyltestosterone, norvinisterone (17α-vinyl-19-nortestosterone) and norgesterone (17α-vinyl-δ⁵⁽¹⁰⁾-19-nortestosterone), have been marketed.[3] They are used as progestins for female hormonal contraception, rather than as AAS.[4]

Vinyltestosterone is a relatively weak AAS.[5][6][7] In one study, it showed approximately one-third and one-fifth of the respective androgenic and anabolic activity of other AAS such as nandrolone (19-nortestosterone), methyltestosterone (17α-methyltestosterone), and ethyltestosterone (17α-ethyltestosterone) in castrated male rats, whereas ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) showed almost no androgenic and anabolic activity (only 1/20th the anabolic potency of vinyltestosterone).[8] Additionally, in women with metastatic breast cancer, vinyltestosterone was found to be ineffective in treating the disease (unlike other AAS such as testosterone propionate or fluoxymesterone)[9] and produced little or no virilization in the women at a dosage of 100 mg intramuscularly three times per week.[10][11]
