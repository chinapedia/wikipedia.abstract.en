WINGO is a brand of a low-cost airline owned by Copa Holdings, S.A.. Copa announced Wingo in October 2016 as a replacement for most of its Copa Airlines Colombia business, which had been losing money for several years, and had lost $29.7 million in the first half of 2016.[1]

Copa said that Wingo would be led by Catalina Bretón, a former JetBlue and Avianca executive, and that Eduardo Lombana, the CEO of Copa Colombia, would be in charge of the airline's administration, finance and operations.[2] Copa said Wingo would use four Boeing 737-700s previously used by Copa, would fly under Copa Colombia’s call sign and codes, and would mostly take over Copa Colombia's routes, adding flights from Bogota and Medellin to Panama Pacifico airport.[3] Copa said that Wingo would offer one class of seats and would charge for baggage, food and beverages, seat assignments, and priority boarding.[4]

Wingo commenced operations on 1 December 2016 with a flight from Bogotá to Cancún.[5]
