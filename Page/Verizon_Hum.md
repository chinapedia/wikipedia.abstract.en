HUM is a vehicle diagnostic and tracking system from Verizon Communications. The system is composed of two devices: a diagnostics reader which connects to a vehicle's OBDII and a speaker with Bluetooth connectivity that can be clipped to the visor.[1] A monthly subscription is required, but also includes a mobile application for reviewing collected data and receiving alerts as well as roadside assistance.[2] The Hum was first revealed in January 2015[3] under the name Verizon Vehicle,[4] but was rebranded before its release in August of that year.[5]

The initial product launch included features such as maintenance reminders, parking assistance, incident alerts, emergency assistance and stolen vehicle location assistance. In 2016 Verizon added location-based features that were marketed to parents as a way of keeping track of teen driving habits. The newer features allow users to set alerts for when the vehicle exceeds certain speeds or goes outside of set geographical boundaries (called geo-fencing).[6] A new model, Hum X, was launched in March 2017, featuring Wi-Fi hotspot capability, and priced at $15/month.[7]


Advantages of the Verizon Hum vs. Similar Systems

Unlike previous aftermarket in-vehicle telematics solutions, such as OnStar FMV, Verizon Hum could be installed on any vehicle from the 1996 model year or newer that included an OBD II (On-Board Diagnostics Version II) port under its dashboard. The OnStar FMV system was only tested to function in select vehicles 2000 or newer.

Also, Verizon Hum can be installed by the consumer, whereas other systems must be professionally installed, which usually entails an installation fee. All the consumer has to do after removing the Verizon Hum from its box is plug the transmitting device into his or her OBD II port on the underside of the vehicle's dashboard (Verizon provides a pictorial make-and-model guide to assist in finding the port), and clip the speaker unit onto their sun visor and power the speaker unit on. The consumer would then activate his or her Verizon Hum device online. The only maintenance required is charging the speaker unit, which can simply be charged via a Micro USB cable.

Some telematics systems also do not provide a Bluetooth connection for hands-free and voice-activated calling, as well as the playback of music on a user's device, whereas Verizon Hum offers this compatibility.

When the 'Check Engine' light illuminates on their vehicle's dash, the driver can talk to a certified mechanic via Verizon Hum, who can analyze the Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) in real time, and provide expert advice as to how to remedy the problem.

Finally, not all telematics systems provide an in-vehicle 4G LTE Wi-Fi connection like Verizon Hum.
