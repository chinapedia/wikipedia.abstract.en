FRANCESCO D'ANTONIO or D'ANTONIO DI BARTOLOMEO (born 1393, active until 1452) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance, mainly active in Florence. He is likely the same _Francesco Fiorentino_ that Giorgio Vasari in his biographies states was a follower of Lorenzo Monaco. In 1429 Francesco joined the painters' guild in Florence. A triptych signed (circa 1415 - 1418) attributed to Francesco is found in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. A painted depiction of the VIRGIN AND CHILD WITH SIX ANGELS AND TWO CHERUBIM (about 1440-50) on a gilded background found at the National Gallery, London. A panel titled MADONNA AND CHILD WITH SWALLOW (about 1420-25) attributed to the artist is found in the collection of the Denver Art Museum.[1][2] [3]
