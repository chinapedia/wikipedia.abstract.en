History

It was built by order of Pope Pius X between 1906 and 1909 on plans by Constantine Schneider, and was solemnly consecrated by the Archbishop of Malines, Cardinal Desire Mercier, 19 March 1909. It was also dedicated to John Berchmans , Belgian Jesuit, as a sign of gratitude to the Belgian Catholics who had given a substantial economic contribution to the building up of the church. The church is home parish, erected by Pope Pius X 12 March 1909 with the Apostolic Letter "In ordinandis", and entrusted to the Josephites of Murialdo. Since 1969 is the seat of the title of cardinal "Immacolata al Tiburtino".[1] Raymundo Damasceno Assis is the incumbent cardinal-protector since 2010.

The interior has a Latin cross with three naves, with vaulted ceilings and stained glass windows. The interior decoration dates back to the Second World War (1946-1954) and was created by Mario Prayer: the apse is depicted the triumph of the Virgin with Saints and Martyrs; many characters depicted in the decoration of the transept and the nave are taken from photographs of men and women who fell in the bombings of 19 July 1943. On the choir behind the high altar, there is the pipe organ, built in 1925 by Zeno Fedeli and then electrified, which has 17 registers on two manuals and pedal.
