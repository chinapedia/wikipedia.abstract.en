_PHYLLIDIOPSIS ANNAE_ is a species of sea slug, a dorid nudibranch, a shell-less marine gastropod mollusk in the family Phyllidiidae.[1]


Distribution

This species was described from Phi Phi Island, southern Thailand. It has been reported from Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Vietnam.[2]


Description

This nudibranch has a blue dorsum with four longitudinal black lines interspersed with raised ridges. It is a small Phyllidiid, growing to about 15Â mm in length. There are black spots in the region between the outer black lines and the edge of the mantle. The rhinophores are black. It is similar to _Phyllidiopsis xishaensis_ except for the colour of the rhinophores, which are white in that species. _Phyllidiopsis phiphiensis_ is also similar but has three instead of four longitudinal black lines on the mantle.[3]


Diet

This species feeds on a sponge.
