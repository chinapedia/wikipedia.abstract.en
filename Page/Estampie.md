The ESTAMPIE (, Occitan and , ) is a medieval dance and musical form which was a popular instrumental and vocal form in the 13th and 14th centuries. The name was also applied to poetry .


Musical form

The estampie is similar in form to the lai, consisting of a succession of repeated sections . According to Johannes de Grocheio, there were both vocal and instrumental estampies (for which he used the Latin calque "stantipes"), which differed somewhat in form, in that the vocal estampie begins with a refrain, which is repeated at the end of each verse . Also according to Grocheio, the repeating sections in both the vocal and instrumental estampie were called _puncta_ (singular _punctus_) , in the form:

    _aa, bb, cc, etc._.

The two statements of each punctus differ only in their endings, described as _apertum_ ("open") and _clausum_ ("closed") by Grocheio, who believed that six _puncta_ were standard for the stantipes (his term for the estampie), though he was aware of stantipes with seven _puncta_ . The structure can therefore be diagrammed as:

    _a+x, a+y; b+w, b+z; etc._.

Sometimes the same two endings are used for all the _puncta_, producing the structure

    _a+x, a+y; b+x, b+y, c+x, c+y, etc._. "Punctus autem est ordinata aggregatio concordantiarum harmoniam facientium

ascendendo et descendendo duas habens partes in principio similes, in fine differentes, qui clausum et apertum communiter appellantur."

A similar structure was shared with the saltarello, another medieval dance.

The earliest reported example of this musical form is the song "Kalenda maya", written by the troubadour Raimbaut de Vaqueiras (1180–1207) to the melody of an estampida played by French jongleurs . "Two poetry treatises describe the _estampie_ as a poetic and musical form, and a music treatise provides details about it as both a vocal form and an instrumental dance" . Fourteenth-century examples include estampies with subtitles such as "Isabella" and "Tre fontane" . Non-estampie dances found in Br. Lib. Add 29987 include dance pairs such as "Lamento di Tristano" and "La Manfredina" (each paired with a following "rotta"), and Dança amorosa (paired with a following "troto") .

Though the estampie is generally monophonic, there are also two-voice compositions in the form of an estampie, such as the three for keyboard in the Robertsbridge Fragment.

According to Grocheio, the fiddle was the supreme instrument of the period, and the stantipes, together with the cantus coronatus and ductia, were the principal forms played on fiddles before the wealthy in their celebration .
