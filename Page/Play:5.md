Reception

The Play:5 has been positively received by critics. The first generation was praised for its ease of access, sound and design, but criticized its limited functionality and then-software. _CNET_ praised the first-generation, stating that "puts it somewhere between the Bose SoundDock II and the larger SoundDock 10.".[17] Will Smith of _Tested_ criticized its price and was befuddled at its inclusion of a headphone jack, but stated that "The S5 is a great addition to the Sonos product line. However, if you haven't already bought into the Sonos vision of total-home music, it may not be the best fit."[18] _What Hi-Fi?_ concluded also that "Although this partnership results in great sound, some would see it as excessively pricey and large for a bedroom, kitchen or study."[19] "Pricing is our only concern with the Sonos Zoneplayer S5 and its family of products" was also a concern from _GoodGearGuide_.[20] In a less positive review, _PC Magazine_ said "simply put, this is the cheapest way for current iPod touch and iPhone owners to enter the seamless world of home audio streaming that Sonos provides."[21]

The second generation received more praise. Critics praised its increase in audio quality, with _CNET_ noting that "this speaker appears to be about 20 to 25 percent bigger than the previous Play:5 and it delivers significantly more bass"[22] and _Engadget_ also concluded that it "the Play:5 is the best speaker Sonos has ever made."[23] _PCMag_ also gave the second generation an Editor's Choice, and that "from a multi-room home audio standpoint, Sonos still leads the pack."[24] _Tom's Guide_ derided the speaker for not having Bluetooth support and exclusivity to Sonos' software, but favored its design, quality and praised its stereo pairing.[25] _The Guardian_ criticized the stereo pair for "almost [being] too loud at times, particularly if youâ€™re looking for background music at night for reading" but gave the Play:5 a positive review nevertheless.[26]
