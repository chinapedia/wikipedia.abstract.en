ELOQUENS™ is a Text-To-Speech software, whose first version was released in 1993 by CSELT. It was the first commercial speech synthesis software able to speak Italian.


Description

It was the first commercial product of the research center CSELT in the field of voice technology: it was built with diphone-technology aimed to reach an high computational efficiency. As a result, the produced voice is still "robotic", but more natural than the previous generation voice implemented in MUSA[1] by CSELT itself. In the past, ELOQUENS was applied to automatically read timetables in the italian train stations and some telephone services provided by Telecom Italia, e.g. the automated address book service.

Nowadays, it is released as freeware: it is nowadays typically used in spoken comments in many YouTube videos.
