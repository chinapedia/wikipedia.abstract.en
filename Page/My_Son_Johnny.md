_MY SON JOHNNY_ is a 1991 American fact-based made-for-television drama film starring Michele Lee, Rick Schroder and Corin Nemec, directed by Peter Levin. It was originally broadcast on CBS as _The CBS Sunday Movie_ on November 10, 1991.


Plot

Johnny Cortino is a 21-year-old hoodlum returning home to Baltimore after a stint in California; exactly why he's back is not clear and, when confronted for details, Johnny is able to fast-talk his way out of every corner he is backed into. But it is clear that his widowed mother Marianne is glad to see her son that, despite his problems, is still the apple of her eye. And it is equally clear that 17-year-old Anthony is terrified that his older brother is back in the house.

As soon as Johnny returns home, the war of intimidation quickly resumes, and Anthony finally reaches the breaking-point when, after a particularly nasty beating by Johnny, he pulls a gun on his brother and shoots him to death. With Anthony facing a life sentence for murder, Marianne has one chance of saving him: following years of denial about Johnny's bullying, she is torn between upholding his memory and defending her younger offspring, but also realizes she must confront the terrible truth about Johnny and, before the eyes of the world, admit there has been a lifetime of sibling violence. In the end, the verdict is read and Anthony is found not guilty.[1]
