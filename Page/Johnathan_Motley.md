JOHNATHAN LANDUS MOTLEY (born May 4, 1995) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), on a two-way contract with the Agua Caliente Clippers of the NBA G League. He played college basketball for the Baylor Bears, where he was a consensus second-team All-American as a junior.


High school career

He led his team to a 32–4 mark as a junior and a 30–5 mark in as a senior, winning back to back district championships. A top 100 recruit nationally, Motley committed to play at Baylor on September 12, 2012.[1]


College career

Motley blossomed into an All-American player as a junior for Baylor, leading the Bears to their first number one ranking as a program during the 2016–17 season.[2] At the close of the season, Motley was named the winner of the Karl Malone Award as the country's best college power forward.[3]

At the close of his junior season, Motley declared his eligibility for the 2017 NBA draft but did not hire an agent, leaving open the option to return to college.[4] He would later hire an agent before signing up for the 2017 NBA Draft Combine, thus ending any chances of returning for his senior year at Baylor.

After recovering from a previous injury he had, Motley would make his official NBA debut on December 14, 2017, recording 4 points in two minutes under a 112–97 loss to the defending champion Golden State Warriors.
