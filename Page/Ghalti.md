Plot

_Ghalti_ aired on A-Plus TV twice a week. The story revolves around Saim and his cousins, Zara and Sanam. Zara is in love with Saim, whereas, Saim and Sanam are interested in each other. Zara and Sanam are sisters; however, Sanam has always lived with her aunt, unaware of the fact that Zara's mother is also her mother. Only the elders in the family know that Zara and Sanam are sisters and they don't feel that it is important that any of the children know about this. On the other hand, Zara lives at Saim's house with her mother, as Saim's father took them in after Zara's father died. The story kicks off when one afternoon, Saim's father announces his surprise engagement to Zara, which comes off as a shock to Saim and Sanam. Saim, being a very obedient son, does not object against his father's decision. Later on, when he does discuss it with his father that he does not want to marry Zara, his father announces that they now shall hold his nikkah to Zara the next day. This makes Saim and Sanam take drastic measures and they end up getting their nikkah done at the court the next morning. The same evening, Saim again fails to inform his father and family about his nikkah to Sanam, and therefore, also ends up getting his nikkah done with Zara, which makes him married to both sisters Sanam and Zara at the same time. The main issue addressed in this drama is how elders and parents fix their children's marriages without their consent. They have instilled their children's minds with fear that they are sometimes unable to voice their opinions. This attitude of the parents forces the children to take extreme measures, which can sometimes result in bigger problems. This drama aims to educate elders against forced marriages and concealing the complete truth from the children, especially in serious matters such as marriage. It also informs youngsters to not only have the guts to voice their opinions in matters that affect their life, but also to avoid extreme measures as the consequences could be awful for everyone. Agha Ali plays the male lead in the drama along with Sania Shamshad and Sidra Batool as female leads who play Zara and Sanam, respectively. All characters have done a tremendous job at acting. Overall, the way Ghalti has progressed, shows how common and serious this issue is and why it should stop. The only way this can be done is by educating the audience on the severity of the matter and also give solutions to solve them, which this drama has so far successfully addressed.
