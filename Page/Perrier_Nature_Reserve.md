]] PERRIER NATURE RESERVE (IUCN IV) is a small nature reserve protecting indigenous plants and primary forest, in the central highlands of Mauritius. It is still closed to the public.[1]


Indigenous vegetation

This CMA nature reserve protects a rare patch of Mauritian primary forest, and a selection of extremely rare endemic plants, such as _Diospyros revaughanii_, _Noronhia macrophylla_ (one plant surviving, down from two reported in 1980), _Syzygium commersonii_, _Tambourissa peltata_, _Croton vaughanii_, _Erythrospermum monticulum_, _Chionanthus boutoni_ (only two plants surviving) and the rare and ornate _Trochetia blackburniana_, among many others.[2][3]

The vegetation type is _"Mauritius Wet Forest"_ with _Sideroxylon_ dominant, and it has been used as a source of original seed, for rehabilitating surrounding areas. The forest canopy is low (under 10 meters) and composed mainly of "Manglier rouge" (_Sideroxylon puberulum_) and "Manglier vert" (_Sideroxylon cinereum_). A very diverse under-storey of species include _Aphloia theiformis_, _Ocotea laevigata_ and _Pandanus eydouxia_ among others.[4]


History and management

It was designated in 1951, but intensive management of the alien invasive species was only begun in 1969, led chiefly by Conservator of Forests Abdool Wahab Owadally. It incorporates only 1.75 ha (the smallest but most pristine nature reserve in Mauritius), and is located in the central highlands of Mauritius (altitude c.550Â m), just north of Mare aux Vacoas.[5]

It is managed by the Mauritian Forestry Service (MFS). It is an extremely sensitive site, and is not yet open to the public.[6][7][8][9][10]
