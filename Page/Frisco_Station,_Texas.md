FRISCO STATION is a 242-acre mixed-use development located in the northwest quadrant of the Dallas North Tollway and Warren Parkway in Frisco, Texas.[1]


History

Frisco Station is one of the primary projects that make up Frisco's “$5 Billion Mile,” a name given by the Frisco Economic Development Corp to the one-mile stretch along the Dallas North Tollway that includes four mixed-use developments totaling more than $5 billion in capital investment.[2] It is being developed by Frisco Station Partners.[3]

The development will feature office, residential, retail, restaurant and medical space. Frisco Station will include a medical and wellness campus, a regional hub for fitness, outdoor spaces for community programming and hiking and biking trails. Development will be centered around a 200,000 square-foot shopping and entertainment district known as "The Hub".[4] The Hub also includes a “lifestyle hotel campus” consisting of four hotel brands with over 600 total rooms.[5]

Frisco Station will also include over 5 million square feet of office space, including mid-rise buildings and corporate campuses, and is projected to employ more than 15,000 people.[6] In May 2016, the Frisco Station Partnership announced plans to begin the first phase of development with a seven-story, 228,000-square-foot office building that will include a fitness center and conference facilities. The building will face the new Dallas Cowboys headquarters and training center, which is located next door at The Star in Frisco.[7]
