LOUIS ARNOLD JACOBY (born September 6, 1942) is a Norwegian singer and writer from Larvik.[1][2] Jacoby grew up in Larvik's Torstrand district but has lived in Ula for many years. He is the son of the writer Arnold Jacoby (1913–2002).[3]

Jacoby has won the Prøysen Award[4][5][6] and the Herman Wildenvey Poetry Award,[7] and he was named "Beer Dog of the Year" () by the Norwegian Brewery Association in 1990.[8] His best-known song "Hverdag" (Everyday)[9] has been named one of Norway's national songs.[10] Jacoby won the summer song competition held by the _Nitimen_ program in 1995 (together with Lars Martin Myhre) for the song "En sommer er aldri over" (A Summer Is Never Over).[11] Jacoby has published _Den store ølviseboka_ (The Big Book of Beer Songs)[12] and released several albums, including _Hverdag_ (Everyday) and _Noen & ingen_ (Some & None). From 1994 to 1999 he was essentially the in-house poet for the TVNorge's talk show _Wesenstund_. For several weeks he held a place on the musical hit list Norsktoppen with the song "Vise ved vindens enger" (A Ballad by the Wind's Meadow). The album _Noen & ingen_ was on Norsktoppen for ten weeks in 2003, including two weeks in first place.[13] In 2008 Jacoby released the CD _Puslespill_ (Jigsaw Puzzle). In 2013 he released the CD _Måneskinn_ (Moonshine). In the fall of 2016 he published a skerry calendar with photos of skerries accompanied by QR codes linking to accompanying songs and videos.[14] He has participated in several in summer and Christmas tours with Lars Martin Myhre.

Jacoby is also a writer and has published the causerie books _Min erotiske hund_ (My Erotic Dog), _Min beduggede vinklubb_ (My Drunken Wine Club), _Om å spise østers_ (About Eating Oysters), and _Den muntre venteværelseboka_ (The Cheerful Waiting Room Book).[15]


Poetry Park

Louis Jacoby was behind the initiative for Larvik's Poetry Park () project,[16] which envisioned poems and songs carved in larvikite located around the town of Larvik. The poetry plaques on larvikite are mounted on buildings, walls, and rock faces to form a route through the town, planned from the town center down to Fritzøe Brygge and Hammerdalen, along the seafront to Tollerodden, and out to a possible new ferry at Revet. The goal was to install 100 plaques by 2012. The project received unanimous support in Larvik's town council.[17] The Norway Arts Council initially allocated NOK 150,000 for the Larvik Poetry Park after the application was handled by its literature committee.
