Junction is a 48-hour international hackathon organized annually in Helsinki, Finland. The event brings together developers, designers, and entrepreneurs from around the world and helps them build solutions to real world challenges from local and multinational companies.[1]

Junction is a part of Major League Hacking and is also the largest hacking event in Europe.[2]


Junction 2015

Junction was first launched in 2015. The event was held on November 6-8th in Kattilahalli, Suvilahti, Helsinki and gathered more than 550 participants and resulted in 145 different projects. Notable partners included Uber, Finnair, Supercell, Reaktor, and others.[3][4] The winner Junction 2015 was Slush Smackdown, from the Supercell Unlimited track. It also won the whole Slush Hacks -hackathon competition main prize, worth 20 000 EUR.[5]


Junction 2016

Junction 2016 was held on November 25-27th at Wanha Satama, in Katajanokka, Helsinki, Finland. About 1300 participants from over 77 nationalities attended the hackathon. Partners included Supercell, Zalando, the European Space Agency, General Electric, Sitra[6], Tieto[7], UPM [8] and others.[9]

Teams had 48 hours to develop their ideas and afterwards demo them to other attendants and judges. The main prize for the winning idea of the 2016 event was 20 000 EUR, and many companies offered their own bounties for solving challenges in a specific way or using pre-specified technology.[10] Teams were provided a number of different API's and other emerging technologies to develop their concepts including Oculus Rifts, HTC Vives, Apple Watches, 3D-printers, Microsoft Hololens, and Estimote Beacons among others.

The winner team was suju.online, who created a tool for event organizers and public transportation decision makers that allows them to design dynamic routing for the self-driving bus. The team originated from the local Aalto University and the hack was part of the Future of Mobility-track.[11]


Junction 2017

Junction 2017 was held on November 24-26th at Dipoli, the main building of the Aalto University Otaniemi campus. About 1500 participants from over 90 nationalities attended the hackathon.[12] Partners included Spotify, Daimler, Smartly.io, European Space Agency, Microsoft and others[13]. Same as before, teams had 48 hours to work on their projects, with the event ending on sunday with a demo expo. This year, the winner of the 20 000 EUR main prize was decided by a new judging process. An open source technology called Gavel was used first to determine the finalists from each track. Then a panel of expert judges inspected each finalist in delicate detail, even going through the project's code repositories. The main prize was won by team GLADOS[14].


Junction 2018

Junction 2018 was held on November 23-25th again at Dipoli, the main building of the Aalto University Otaniemi campus. About 1300 participants from all over the world attended the hackathon.[15] Partners included Facbook, Daimler, Supercell, Mckinsey, Epic Games, Vkontakte, Ericsson and others.[16] Same as before, teams had 48 hours to work on their projects, with the event ending on sunday with a demo expo. For 2018, the judging process for the winner of the 20 000 EUR main prize was improved once more. Instead of a multi-level process that was unclear to participants, Junction 2018 used a peer judging system, where participants themselves chose the main winner. The main prize was won by Oneiro, created by the previous winning team GLADOS.[17]
