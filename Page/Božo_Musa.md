Club career

A native of Široki Brijeg, Musa went through all the ranks of the NK Široki Brijeg academy,[2] even featuring once for his youth national team, but started his career at the Croatian Third Football League club HNK Zmaj Makarska.[3] He went on to feature in a series of lower-tier clubs, along with very brief stints at top-tier NK Croatia Sesvete and RNK Split. In 2012, he returned to Bosnia and Herzegovina, playing a season for the second-tier HNK Branitelj in Mostar, but moved back to Croatia the following season, signing for second-tier NK Zagreb. Attaining promotion with the club, he remained in Zagreb playing in the Prva HNL until he annulled his contract due to unpaid wages in the summer of 2015.[4] He signed for NK Slaven Belupo in early 2016.

On 3 January 2019, Musa joined Polish club Miedź Legnica.[5]
