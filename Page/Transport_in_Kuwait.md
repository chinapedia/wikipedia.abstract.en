As an oil rich nation, TRANSPORT IN KUWAIT is largely road-based with one car for every 2.25 people. Bus services make up Kuwait's entire public transport network as the country currently has no rail infrastructure. Several railways have been planned for many years but no plans have materialized, including a metro for Kuwait City. Kuwait has several maritime ports along the Persian Gulf. There are seven airports, the largest of which and solely allocated for civil use is Kuwait International Airport.


Railways

Overview

Kuwait does not have railways, although increasing congestion on the country's roads has led to several railway projects being planned.[1] Kuwait City would form one terminus of the proposed Gulf Railway, a railway network which will run from Kuwait to Oman, via cities across the Persian Gulf.[2]A four line, , metro network within Kuwait city is also in the planning stages.[3][4] A privately owned railway track of unknown length is proposed as part of a park project called "The Boulevard". This park is opened in April 2016, but the railway project did not materialize. [5]

Metro

The Kuwait Metropolitan Rapid Transit System Project is a planned four-line metro network which will total 160Â km with 69 stations.[6] It has been subject to many delays and, as of September 2017, has not started construction.


Road transport

As a nation with one car per 2.25 people,[7] Kuwait relies heavily on its road network for transportation. The total length of paved and unpaved roads was 6,524km in 2009.[8] Traffic congestion is common throughout the day, particularly in Kuwait City.[9]

As there are no railways, the country's public transport network consists entirely of bus routes. The state-owned Kuwait Public Transportation Company was established in 1962. It runs local bus routes across Kuwait as well as longer distance services to other Persian Gulf states.[10] The main private bus company is CityBus, which operates about 28 routes across the country.[11] Another private bus company, Kuwait Gulf Link Public Transport Services, was started in 2006. It runs local bus routes across Kuwait and longer distance services to neighbouring Arab countries.[12]
