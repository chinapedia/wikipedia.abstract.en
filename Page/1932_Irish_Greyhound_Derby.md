The 1932 IRISH GREYHOUND DERBY took place during August with the final being held on 15 August 1932 at Shelbourne Park in Dublin.[1]

In 1928 Harold's Cross introduced a competition called the National Derby that would become the modern day Irish Derby, the race was unofficial at this stage because Harold's Cross organised the National Derby without consulting with the Irish racing authorities.[2]

In 1932 the Irish Coursing Club issued a new list of classic races to be run in 1932 and controversy followed because Harold's Cross had been given the Oaks and not the Derby. Shelbourne Park had been given the premier event despite the fact that Harold's Cross had effectively started the competition.[3]

The winner Guideless Joe won Â£200 and was owned by leading jockey Jack Moylan and bred by Cornelius Forde.[4]
