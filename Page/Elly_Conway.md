ELLY BRENNAN (also CONWAY) is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera _Neighbours_, played by Jodi Anasta. She was originally played by Kendell Nunn from her first appearance on 13 December 2001, until her departure in May 2002. _Neighbours_ marked Nunn's first television role. The character was introduced as Susan Kennedy's (Jackie Woodburne) teenage niece, giving her instant connections within the show. Nunn said Elly had "a lot of attitude", while she was also billed as being rebellious and spirited. Elly did not like living in Ramsay Street, but she eventually befriends her neighbour Michelle Scully (Kate Keltie). A notable storyline for the character focused on her relationship with her estranged father Ian Conway (Peter Maver). When she gets in contact with Ian, he leads her to believe that Susan's husband Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) is actually her real father.

The character was reintroduced on 18 July 2016, with Anasta taking over the role. She was initially contracted for three years and chose not to relocate to Melbourne, where the show is filmed, as her family is based in Sydney. Anasta explained that since Elly's last appearance, she had trained as an English teacher. Elly is now portrayed as a feisty, unpredictable "free spirit". Anasta also said used her outgoing persona to hide her insecurities. The character's early storylines saw her clash with her student Piper Willis (Mavournee Hazel) and later Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner), when she flirted with Steph's partner Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor). Later storylines saw Elly miscarry after being bitten by a venomous snake, and establish an on-off relationship with Ned Willis (Ben Hall). Elly's housemate Angus Beaumont-Hannay (Jai Waetford) develops an obsessive crush on her and takes advantage of her twice, which almost causes her to lose her job and home. Producers introduced Elly's former boyfriend Finn Kelly (Rob Mills) in March 2017, which led to further exploration of her background.


Casting

On 22 November 2001, Kylie Miller of _The Age_ reported that actress Kendell Nunn had joined the cast as Elly, along with Blair McDonough as Stuart Parker.[1] _Neighbours_ marked Nunn's first television role.[2] The show's producer Peter Dodds told Wendy Granditer of _Inside Soap_ that Elly would have instant ties to the show as she would be introduced as the "rebellious niece" of Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne).[3] Nunn made her first appearance as Elly during the episode broadcast on 13 December 2001.[4]


Development

Characterisation and introduction

Elly was introduced as the teenage daughter of Susan Kennedy's sister, Liz Conway (Christine Keogh).[5] The show's producer Peter Dodds stated that Elly's arrival in Erinsborough would occur at the same as her cousin, Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine), goes into labour in "typically trying circumstances."[6] It later emerged that Elly had been expelled from her school after she was caught smoking cannabis.[7] Of Elly, Nunn said "She's a great character - she has a lot of attitude and sometimes gets on the wrong side of people."[8] Nunn explained that Elly does not initially like Susan's husband Karl (Alan Fletcher) because she has been without a father figure in her life. She also dislikes being in Ramsay Street.[9] The official _Neighbours_ website described the character as being "smart, insightful and just a touch rebellious".[10] The writer added that she was a "spirited teenager".[11] During her time in Erinsborough, Elly befriended her cousin Darcy Tyler (Mark Raffety) and her neighbour Michelle Scully (Kate Keltie).[12]

Following the character's reintroduction in 2016, Anasta described the older Elly as "fun, feisty", unpredictable and wild.[13] She also called Elly "a free spirit" and thought she was "a bit of a tomboy".[14] Anasta went on to say that while her character has many layers of naughtiness, she has "a heart of gold."[15] Anasta thought Elly was a strong character, who often hides her insecure side with her "outgoing, positive personality".[16] The actress told Daniel Falconer of FemaleFirst that Elly often goes out to party instead of focusing on her work.[17] Anasta did not think she shared many of Elly's personality traits, such as her flirty and unpredictable side, but she thought that she did have some of Elly's strength.[18] Anasta also compared Elly to her _Home and Away_ character Martha MacKenzie, calling Elly "much more troublesome, and manipulative and vindictive than Martha; a lot more fiery and nasty."[19] In the years away from Erinsborough, Elly has become an English teacher, like her aunt Susan.[20] Anasta called Elly's teaching style unconventional,[21] but thought she was "naturally gifted" at it.[22] Anasta had trouble understanding how Elly manages to balance her job with her personal life, saying "I think it's because Elly is smart – she's a naturally good teacher – but she's also lazy and focuses on doing what she wants."[23]

Paternity

Towards the end of her stay with the Kennedys, Elly decided to meet with her estranged father.[24] Karl tried to help and managed to get in touch with Ian Conway (Peter Maver), as he felt that Elly might settle down if she met with her father. However, Elly soon found out and contacted Ian herself to set up a meeting.[25] When Ian arrived he insisted on having some time alone with Elly. Nunn told an _Inside Soap_ columnist, "Once Karl and Susan have left the room, Ian tells Elly that he's not her dad but he knows who is. Then he comes out with it – her real dad is Karl!"[26] Ian claims that Karl and her mother had an affair and Elly was born as a result. Elly was horrified by Ian's revelation, but the more she thought about it, the more it made sense. Nunn thought that since Elly and Karl did not get along, part of her did not want it to be true. But because she wanted a family, she hoped that she did belong to Karl.[27] When Elly looked into Karl's background and found out he had previously had an affair, she started to believe that he was her father. However, it was later revealed that Ian really was Elly's biological father.[28]

Reintroduction

On 28 April 2016, Jonathon Moran of _The Daily Telegraph_ reported that the character would be returning to the show with actress Jodi Anasta in the role.[29] Anasta told Moran that she was "thrilled to be working" and said that her "biggest hurdle" was learning all of her scripts.[30] She chose not to relocate to Melbourne, where the show is filmed, as her family is based in Sydney. She initially signed a three-year contract and made her first appearance as Elly on 18 July 2016.[31][32] Anasta explained that in the character's fictional backstory, she has been living in Bondi and visiting her mother in Sweden. Elly has trained as a schoolteacher and has come to Erinsborough to teach alongside Susan.[33] She thought Elly was different, as she had "gone through those young adult years where you test the boundaries."[34]

Elly returns to Erinsborough amid the high school formal and clash with Piper Willis (Mavournee Hazel) over Tyler Brennan (Travis Burns).[35] When Piper sees Elly talking to Tyler, Piper throws a drink over her, before learning Elly is her new English teacher. Of the incident, Anasta explained, "It's just some harmless flirting in Elly's eyes. From then on, their relationship is on a downward spiral. So I can tell you Elly won't be making friends with Piper!"[36] Elly also got on the wrong side of Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) by flirting with her partner Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor).[37] Anasta said Elly enjoys flirting with Mark, but had no intention of trying to take things further. She enjoys the company of all the Brennan brothers and develops a good friendship with them.[38] Anasta also said that Elly would be accepted eventually, as people get to know her, and she would go on to make friends.[39]

Elly moves in with Karl and Susan on Ramsay Street straight away. Anasta was pleased with the way Elly and Susan's relationship is portrayed, saying "Susan doesn't necessarily agree with the way Elly goes about things, but she doesn't judge her either."[40] When asked by Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy what Elly and Susan's relationship was like, Anasta replied that they have a very mother/daughter relationship.[41] Elly brings out Susan's "spicy side" and they have fun together, but Elly can also talk to Susan about her life. She also pointed out that there was an interesting contrast between Elly and Susan's teaching styles.[42] Mark James Lowe of _All About Soap_ observed that Elly appeared to be running away from something, and Anasta said Elly's past would be revealed in due course. She also told the show's official website that Elly had a broken heart and had some "personal issues to battle".[43] The actress thought it would be "a big summer for Elly as she finds her place".[44] She added that Elly would leave some fractured relationships in her wake, but she would also form some solid ones.[45]

Snake bite and miscarriage

Anasta teased Elly's first storyline, saying it would happen quickly and be "quite a big tragedy". She also said that it would be linked to Elly's past and give the audience more insight into the character.[46] A week after her return, Elly is bitten by a venomous tiger snake on Ramsay Street.[47] Elly had spent the day having several "run-ins" with Steph and they later begin arguing in the street, where Elly notices Nell Rebecchi (Scarlett Anderson) is about to come into contact with the snake. She manages to pick Nell up and get her out of the way, but the snake bites her instead.[48] Anasta was worried that no one would want to help Elly, as she had upset a few of the other characters since her arrival, but she thought that the event showed them that she is not all bad.[49] She stated, "I think what this whole scenario has shown is that Elly does have a good heart. What she did for Nell was quite heroic I think, and shows another side of Elly; that she puts others before herself."[50] Anasta told the show's official website that she enjoyed working with the real snake during the storyline.[51]

As Elly is rushed to the local hospital, Karl is waiting to treat her and he knows that the snake's venom could be fatal. However, blood tests also showedthat Elly is pregnant.[52] Elly was unaware of her condition and she has very little time to process the news, before Karl tells her that the antidote she needs could harm the baby.[53] Elly is "torn", as she does not want to risk the baby's health, but Karl tells her she has no choice but to take the antidote, and she allows him to administer it.[54] Shortly after, Elly goes into anaphylactic shock and Karl has to administer some adrenaline too, which increases the pressure on her body, causing Elly to miscarry the baby.[55] Susan offers her support to Elly and when she learns the truth behind Elly's problems, she begins to feel sorry for her.[56]

Relationship with Ned Willis

When asked what storylines were ahead for Elly, Anasta mentioned that there would be "a bit of romance on the cards" with a character that was already familiar to viewers.[57] In August, Elly was introduced to Ned Willis (Ben Hall) and they soon go on a date.[58] Following that, Elly decides to play "hard to get" with Ned, but her aloofness causes him to ask Madison Robinson (Sarah Ellen) out on a date instead of her. This leads Elly to "throw her all into the challenge" of gaining Ned's attention once more.[59] While looking through Ned's wallet, Elly finds a lock of blonde hair and immediately thinks it belongs to Lauren Turner (Kate Kendall), Ned's former crush and his father's partner.[60] Hall explained that the romance with Elly starts out with lust and is "very unstable", before it begins to develop into something more long-term.[61] He believed the relationship had potential to be long lasting, but admitted that Ned initially uses it as an opportunity to prove to everyone that he has moved on from Lauren.[62] Hall described Ned and Elly's romance as a "passionate, fiery, 'up and down' sort of relationship", with the potential for drama.[63]

Hall thought the couple were a good match, saying that it was a pairing that did not look like it would work, but that it just did.[64] He also stated that as the characters were such passionate people, when they argued, it was their way of showing that they cared about one another.[65] Ned later breaks up with Elly and warns her to stay away from him, as he will only put her in danger. Feeling rejected, Elly goes to The Waterhole for a drink and meets a stranger, who buys her a drink.[66] When Ned sees them together, he realises the stranger is Jacka Hills (Brad McMurray), the husband of his former lover. Ned realises that Jacka is using Elly as part of his revenge plan and tries to fight him, before deciding to leave town.[67] Ned and Elly are briefly reunited during Hall's third guest stint with the serial, but writers soon decided to end the relationship ahead of his departure.[68] Elly tells Ned that she needs to be single and independent for a time, and Ned accepts her decision, having realised that they just have "bad timing."[69]

Angus Beaumont-Hannay's crush

Jai_Waetford.jpg (_pictured_) plays Angus Beaumont-Hannay, who develops an obsessive crush on Elly.]] When teen character Angus Beaumont-Hannay (Jai Waetford) was reintroduced in September, a new story arc saw him develop a crush on Elly.[70] After he returns to stay at the Kennedy home, Angus "takes a clear interest" in Elly, but her cousin Ben Kirk (Felix Mallard) warns him off. However, Angus ignores Ben and manages to cause tension between Elly and Ned.[71] Elly becomes aware that Angus has a crush on her, but she does not know how serious his feelings are.[72] Anasta commented, "Elly is aware there is some sort of attraction, but definitely not how deep."[73] At the school Halloween dance, Angus sings directly at Elly, leading her to realise that his crush is "bordering on obsession."[74]

After growing uncomfortable with the attention, Elly returns home early and falls asleep on the couch, where she dreams about kissing Mark Brennan, who she has a crush on, Angus comes home and kisses her, leading Elly to kiss him back, as she thinks it is Mark.[75] Anasta said Elly "freaks out" when she realises it is Angus kissing her instead. Elly did not think Angus would ever act on his feelings and she feels "violated" by his actions.[76] Susan becomes suspicious that something has happened between them, but Elly decides to not to tell her about the kiss.[77] Elly does tell her friend Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano), who confronts Angus and warns him away from Elly, leaving Angus "mortified".[78]

Weeks later, Elly warns Angus to be careful after he befriends "a bad crowd" at his new school.[79] Later that night, Elly receives a phone call from a drunken Angus, who she and Tyler Brennan rescue from a bar in the city. Angus believes that this means she has feelings for him too.[80] Anasta explained that while Elly has been aware of Angus's crush on her, she has not led him on, saying "despite her sometimes questionable behaviour, Elly does have a moral compass – especially when it comes to things like this."[81] Elly keeps the incident from Karl and Susan, as she does not want Angus to get into trouble. Anasta called the decision "Elly's biggest downfall", and she believed that if Elly told Susan what had happened, Susan would be able to help.[82] Anasta also pointed out that Elly stood to lose her job and her home if Angus continued to put her in compromising situations.[83]

Elly's former boyfriend Derek Meeps (Scott Tweedie) was later introduced. Angus becomes jealous and tries to stop Elly and Derek from meeting, but fails.[84] Elly spends the afternoon with Derek, and she is "delighted" when it seems they are reuniting.[85] However, after they have sex, Elly is left "deeply upset" by his sudden departure.[86] Elly accepts Angus's support and when he kisses her again in her bedroom. Susan catches Angus and she struggles to believe that he was just consoling Elly.[87] Susan reports Elly to the education board and asks her to leave the house.[88] The storyline concluded with Angus's departure from the show.[89] Elly admits to Susan that Angus had taken advantage of her twice, leading the police to question Angus. Elly opts not to press charges against him, after he assures her that he knows his actions were wrong and he will not repeat them. Angus then leaves Erinsborough.[90]

Feud with Finn Kelly

Rob_Mills_(8583964369).jpg, played by Rob Mills (_pictured_), was introduced in March 2017.]] Producers introduced Elly's former boyfriend Finn Kelly (Rob Mills) in March 2017.[91] Ahead of his arrival, it is revealed on-screen that Elly had previously tried to run him down in her car. Anasta explained that following their break-up, Elly got in her car and drove straight at him.[92] She continued, "I'd love to say we all have a moment like that – but that's not true! Most of us would hit the brakes. Elly just kept driving, though – so thank God he got out of the way."[93] The actress also explained that Finn was married when he dated Elly, who was unaware he had a wife. Anasta described him as "the ultimate charmer and heartbreaker", and that because he broke Elly's heart, she is surprised to see him take a job at Erinsborough High.[94] Finn's introduction helped to further explore Elly's background, with scenes showing where Elly came from, and all the manipulation and embarrassment she had endured and overcome.[95]

Elly tries to force Finn's resignation from the school, believing that they cannot work together. Susan advises Elly to stay professional, but she realises no one will believe her about Finn's "darker side". Finn later follows to the Back Lane Bar, where they cause a scene because she refuses to forgive him.[96] Following this, Finn takes over Xanthe Canning's (Lilly Van der Meer) tutoring from Elly and gets involved in Ben's career plans too. A message about the incident at the bar is posted online, leaving Elly to suspect it was Finn. She also fears that he is trying to isolate her. During a confrontation, Elly pushes Finn away from her and he falls down some stairs in front of Xanthe.[97]

Reception

Ahead of her introduction, Kylie Miller of _The Age_ branded Elly a "likeable delinquent."[98] Michael Idato of _The Sydney Morning Herald_ criticised Nunn's acting ability and her debut performance on _Neighbours_, writing that he was "rendered speechless" by her poor performance.[99] Idato went on to say that her arrival was "so thoroughly underwhelming and her delivery so off the mark" that no one noticed McDonough's introduction during the same episode.[100] He also dubbed Elly a "hybrid of the brazen-hussy-troublemaker and dumped-by-a-disinterested-mum character types that seem to reproduce like rabbits on soaps."[101] Observing Elly's behaviour, a _Liverpool Echo_ reporter commented, "Stand well back – Elly is about to fly off the handle." [102] Roz Laws, writing for the _Sunday Mercury_, dubbed Elly a "troublesome teen".[103] A writer for the BBC said Elly's most notable moment from her first stint was "Asking Karl if he was her real father."[104]

When Elly was bitten by the snake, Phillip Portman of the _Daily Star_ quipped "Only on _Neighbours_ can someone arrive in Ramsay Street and a week later, be fighting for their life."[105] Portman also dubbed the character "promiscuous".[106] A _TV Week_ contributor observed, "It hasn't been the smoothest introduction to Ramsay Street for newcomer Elly."[107] Kate MacCarthy of the _Radio Times_ wondered if Elly and Ned were "set to be the cutest new couple in Ramsay Street?"[108] While Sarah Ellis of _Inside Soap_ observed "it's clear from the get-go that this is going to be an interesting relationship given that both Ned and Elly are a little on the mischievous side!"[109] A reporter for the _Liverpool Echo_ noted that the school Halloween dance was "aptly horrific for Elly" when Angus sang to her.[110]
