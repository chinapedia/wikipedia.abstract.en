CLEARY is an extinct town in Livingston County, in the U.S. state of Missouri. The GNIS classifies it as a populated place.[1]

A post office called Cleary was established in 1845, and remained in operation until 1901.[2] The community possibly derives its name from J. I. McCleery, the proprietor of a local mill. [3]
