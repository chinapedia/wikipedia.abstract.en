3007_CUTTING_WAVES.jpg NEW_KID_ON_THE_BLOCK.jpg The DAMEN STAN 3007 PATROL is a patrol vessel in The Damen Group's family of Damen Stan patrol vessels.[1][2][3][4] The base design is built around an axe bow, and shallow draft.

Vessels built for the Bahamas are equipped with a stern launching ramp, so its waterjet powered pursuit boat can be launched and retrieved without requiring the vessel to first come to a stop.[5][6] The Bahamanian vessels are designed to carry a complement of 13 crew for up to a week.

Four 3007 vessels will be built for the Bahamas. The first one was to be delivered in mid 2015.[7]

Damen offers five choices of engines for the vessel, which provide top speeds between 22 and 32 knots.[8]
