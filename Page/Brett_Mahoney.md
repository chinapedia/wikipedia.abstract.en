Fictional character biography

Brett Mahoney is the partner of Stacy Dolan. In his first appearance they were investigating the death of a John Doe. The only clue they had was from a witness who described an unusual being later identified by Reed Richards as Uatu the Watcher.[1] After learning that the John Doe is an extraterrestrial and that deceased spy Yelena Belova are somehow involved, Mahoney and Dolan later discover that the crime is related to a Muslim named Jaafar Yoosuf who Dolan arrested earlier for "buying" superpowers. They break into Yoosuf's apartment, but he is absent.[2] When Dolan is accused of killing the John Doe, as evidenced by security footage showing her committing the crime, Mahoney simply tells her to remain silent as he is aware that something is wrong.[3] Mahoney is visited by an escaped Dolan who fakes her death and leaves a book for him to read telling him the truth about what happened.[4]

Mahoney is hired by Old Man Logan and Storm to examine the body of a dead mutant. He concludes that he was killed by a special bullet and that other mutants were killed the same way.[5] Afterwards, Mahoney and the NYPD arrest the culprit X-Cutioner.[6]

Foggy regularly bribes Brett into giving Nelson & Murdock client referrals by giving him cigars for his mother Bess.[7] However, he is not above sympathy, as he summons Matt, Karen and Foggy to the morgue to identify Elena Cardenas' body, as he is aware that they were close to.[8] After Detective Christian Blake is shot on Fisk's orders, Brett is assigned to stand guard outside Blake's hospital room and is present when Blake's partner Carl Hoffman is blackmailed by Fisk into poisoning Blake to keep him from talking.[9] After Fisk kills Ben Urich, Matt and Foggy turn to Brett for assistance in taking down Fisk, as he is one of the few cops in the precinct not on Fisk's payroll. When the FBI start arresting anyone allied with Wilson Fisk, Mahoney is shown satisfied when the police officers on Wilson Fisk's side are arrested. Ultimately, Brett is the one to recapture Fisk after Daredevil stops his attempt to escape custody.[10] Brett has an expanded role in season 2 of _Daredevil_.

Thanks to Foggy, Mahoney had to pretend to arrest Karen to keep the FBI Agents on Fisk's side from killing her. After getting Foggy and Karen away from the crime scene, Foggy thanks Brett for his help.[19] In light of the attack on Nadeem's household, Mahoney has his family living with his mother for a while. He does provide a police escort for Matt Murdock and Nadeem to get to the courthouse to meet with Blake Tower.[20] Mahoney and the police later find Felix Manning hanging from the building and have him taken away as Foggy has Mahoney have his police officers attending Fisk's wedding to Vanessa Marianna.
