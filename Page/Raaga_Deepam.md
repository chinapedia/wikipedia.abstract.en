Plot

Chakravarthy (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) a musician, loves a beautiful girl Kalyani (Jayasudha), daughter of a millionaire Gopal Rao (Rao Gopal Rao). Just before their marriage, an unforeseen situation arises, Chakravarthy meets his Master (Gummadi) who brought him up. At that moment, he learns that Master's only daughter Gowri (Lakshmi) has become mentally sick as her father is unable to perform her marriage. To protect her, Master requests Chakravarthy to tell a lie that he is going to marry her and to show the gratitude he does so. Afterward, Master realizes that Chakravarthy’s alliance is already fixed, so, he pleads Kalyani to save his daughter when she too convinces Chakravarthy and makes him marry Gowri. Thereafter, Chakravarthy also performs Kalyani’s marriage with a rich person Ranganath (Ranganath). Years roll by, Charkravarthy couple is blessed with 2 children but unfortunately, Gowri is a vainglory woman who nags her husband and ill-treats everyone. Meanwhile, Chakravarthy spots Kalyani on streets with a child when he finds out that Ranganath has abandoned her as Gopal Rao is bankrupted. At present, Chakravarthy gives her shelter which leads to several disputes & misunderstandings in his family. Here Gowri attributes illicit relation between Chakravarthy & Kalyani when Kalyani leaves the house. Being aware of it, angered Chakravarthy chides Gowri and reveals the truth. Knowing it, eccentric Gowri too leaves the house as her husband does not have any love towards her except courtesy. On the other side, disturbed Kalyani commits suicide when Chakravarthy makes Gowri realize her mistake.
