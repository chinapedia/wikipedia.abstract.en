The event featured a major tournament for six fighting games, including _Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition_ and _Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3_, as well as various smaller-scale competitions.

The tournaments held at Evo 2012 were livestreamed through the Twitch.tv online video service.[1] A "Road to Evo" tournament series started in January 2012, in which competitors could earn seeding points for the main event.[2]


Games

Six major tournaments were held at Evo 2012. The games played were:

-   _Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition 2012_
-   _Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3_
-   _Street Fighter X Tekken_
-   _Mortal Kombat_
-   _The King of Fighters XIII_
-   _Soulcalibur V_

Evo 2012 was the first event in the Championship Series to include a major _King of Fighters_ tournament. The 2011 reboot of the _Mortal Kombat_ series benefited from multiple balancing updates after its release, allowing the game to be popular among the fighting game community where earlier games in the series weren't. The _Mortal Kombat_ tournament featured the second-largest prize pool at Evo 2012, after _Street Fighter IV_. Spin-off _Street Fighter X Tekken_, meanwhile, was unpopular among the fighting game community at the time. The game featured various bugs and unbalanced aspects.[3]

The event also featured various smaller-scale competitions, such as an exclusive _Super Street Fighter II Turbo_ tournament, and side tournaments for _Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown_ and _Skullgirls_.[4] Sony showcased a playable demo for _PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale_, while NetherRealm Studios revealed gameplay footage of _Injustice: Gods Among Us_ at Evo 2012.[5]


Tournament summary

While the recent release of _Street Fighter x Tekken_ caused players to juggle between more familiar aspects of the characters and the game's more unusual features, the _King of Fighters XIII_ tournament was praised by commentators for its high-level play, unexpected for such a new game. Meanwhile, Brenna Hillier of _VG247_ described the _Mortal Kombat_ tournament at Evo 2012 as a "mixed bag", featuring plenty of unusual play styles.[6]

Though there was a lot of discussion regarding whether the character Phoenix in _Marvel vs. Capcom_ is overpowered compared to other selectable characters in the game, competitor Filipino Champ won the tournament with the characters Magneto, Dormammu and Doctor Doom. The final match at Evo 2012 was the _Street Fighter IV_ finals, in which Infiltration defeated GamerBee to claim the title.[7]
