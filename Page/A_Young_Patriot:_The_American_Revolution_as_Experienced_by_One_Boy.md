Reception

The _School Library Journal_ in a review of _A YOUNG PATRIOT_, called it "An outstanding example of history brought to life through the experience of one individual"[1] and _Booklist_ wrote "Although source notes would have been a welcome addition, young readers researching the military and social history of the American Revolution will find this an excellent resource." [2] In a star review _Kirkus Reviews_ wrote "This work offers a view of the Revolutionary War missing from most books--instead of the broad sweep of dramatic events and change, readers see the daily misery, boredom, confusion, terror, and only occasional triumph of army life. Murphy provides the best of both, the drama and the grind, appeasing readers' fascination with war without romanticizing it."[3]

The Cooperative Children's Book Center called it a " well-documented, carefully developed narrative".[4]
