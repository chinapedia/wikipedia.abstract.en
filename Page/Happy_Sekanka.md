HAPPY SEKANKA is a South African brewmaster. She is currently the brewmaster at the all-women brewery, Oakes Brew House, created by Thea Blom.[1]

Sekanka is from the Limpopo province.[2] She never imagined she would become a brewer, and at one time, hated the taste of beer.[3] Sekanka was recruited to work at Oakes Brew House by Thea Blom, who had been her manager at a previous restaurant also owned by Blom.[4] She was taught how to brew beer by Delia Bailey, a microbiologist and co-owner of Oakes Brew House.[5]

Like many women in brewing, Sekanka has faced gender and racial stereotypes in the industry, where some men are surprised a black woman is making their beer.[6]
