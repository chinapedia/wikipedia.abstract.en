In addition to theatrical performances, the festival hosts dancers and live music.[2] In 2016, artists produced 55 shows.[3] The festival is open-access, which means that anyone who registers may perform.

The venues are in and around the Octagon, the city centre of Dunedin. Among these are Allen Hall at the University of Otago; The Fortune Theatre;[4] the Octagon Athenaeum; and Dog With Two Tails, a nearby caf√© and bar.[5]
