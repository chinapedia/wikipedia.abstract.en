GIWARGIS WARDA was an Assyrian poet who lived in the 13th century.


Life

He was originally from Arbela and lived during the time of the Mongol invasions of the Levant.


Works

Warda was a significant poet of the Syriac renaissance of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a number of whose poems were incorporated into the liturgy of the Church of the East.[1]

Only 34 out of 150 poems attributed to Giwargis Warda have been published so far.[2]

His most famous work is _The Book of the Rose_.[3][4]

Several hymns are the commemoration of historical events. One concerns a famine that struck northern Mesopotamia in 1223. One poem addresses the Mongol raids that plagued the region in 1235-1236.[5]
