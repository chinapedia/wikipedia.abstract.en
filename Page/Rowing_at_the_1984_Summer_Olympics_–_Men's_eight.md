The MEN'S COXED EIGHT (M8+) competition at the 1984 Summer Olympics took place at Lake Casitas in Ventura County, California, United States. It was held from 31 July to 5 August. New Zealand had won the last two world championships, and the other strong team, East Germany, was absent from the event due to the Eastern Bloc boycott. This made New Zealand the strong favourite. But the final was won by Canada, with the USA and Australia the other medallists, and New Zealand coming a disappointing fourth.[1]


Background

East Germany had for many years been the dominating country for this boat class. From the 1976 Summer Olympics to the 1980 Summer Olympics, the country won every gold at Olympic and World Rowing Championships level.[2][3][4][5][6] At the 1981 World Rowing Championships, East Germany came in fourth place, with the Soviet Union winning gold.[7] In 1982 and 1983, the event was won by New Zealand, with East Germany coming second on both occasions.[8][9] With the Eastern Bloc boycott affecting the 1984 Summer Olympics, New Zealand was thus regarded as the strong favourite.[10] Another medal contender was the United States; they had won the 1983 Pan American Games.[11]
