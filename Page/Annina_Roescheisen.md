ANNINA ROESCHEISEN is a German-Slovenian multi-media artist that resides and works between Munich and New York City.[1]

With a strong artistic heritage as the granddaughter of German artist Ernst Moritz Geyger (1861-1941), Roescheisen graduated from the Elite University of Ludwig Maximilian, Munich, Annina Roescheisen has a Masters in History of Art, and political Philosophy and Folklore.

In 2015, her exhibition _What Are You Fishing For_ was displayed at the Palazzo Bembo as part of the 56th Venice Biennale[2] and was nominated for the Aesthetica Art Prize.[3] The series was also displayed at the Elliot Levenglick Gallery in New York City.[4].


Early life and career

Born in Germany in 1982 to a German father and Slovenian mother,[5] Roescheisen spent her childhood in Munich. She received her master's degree in History of Art, Philosophy and Folklore from the Ludwig Maximillian University of Munich.[6]

In 2006, Roescheisen began working at Sotheby's in Munich. In 2008, she moved to Paris and in 2015 to New York.

In 2012, Roescheisen began making her own art, using photography, video, sculpture, installation and other mediums.[7][8] Roescheisen opened two exhibitions in Paris in 2013. In 2015, her exhibition _What Are You Fishing For_ was displayed at the Palazzo Bembo as part of the 56th Venice Biennale.[9] Roescheisen was awarded the BORN Art Award for her _A Love Story_ exhibition in 2015.[10] Since 2012 she is performing in”Systema Occam” by French contemporary artist Xavier Veilhan. This performance was shown at the MAMO/ Le Corbusier in Marseille, the Delacroix Museum in Paris, the Hermès Foundation in Paris, and the French Alliance Institute in New York, to name a few.

In their 2015 review of her series, “What are You Fishing For”, Wall Street International emphasised that “Her “holistic” approach to art allows for a broad spectrum of activities and has seen the artist become an active participator in the human rights field and a collaborator with fellow artists.”

In 2016, Time Out New York named her as one of the top 10 emerging artists to follow.


Artistic themes

Roescheisen is a pluri disciplinary artis. Her work includes video, photography, drawing, painting, sculpture, installation, performance art, and documentary.

Roescheisen’s multimedia works are held together by underlying concepts such as iconography, poetry, literature, Medieval art, German Romanticism, Gothic architecture, the fairytale, the inspection of dream and reality, and the visible and invisible world. But above all her work deals with the observation, reflection and investigation of humans and their emotions.

Throughout her artistic practice a constant interplay between dream and reality takes place. The medium of video is used to further explore this relationship where it is considered ‘painting in motion and emotion’. The videos are slow and deliberate, the music compositions shaped to form a new level of interpretation, encouraging the viewer to exist outside time constraints, constrictions and pressures. Her work shifts between childhood and adulthood, shedding light on human existence in all its forms.


Philanthropy

In the context of Roescheisen’s social and philanthropic engagements she collaborates with institutions worldwide such as the United Nations Foundation and the BWM Foundation. She was invited to numerous public talks including the World Economic Forum (Davos), Global Table (Bogota & Berlin), and Summit of Peace (Bogotá), to speak and share the impact and importance of art from an interdisciplinary approach. She believes art can be used to ensure and engage in collaborations with governments, institutions, NGOs, as well as locally with universities and individuals to promote an agenda of sustainability, social welfare, and human rights. In 2013, Roescheisen served as the "godmother" of the Ninoo Association for Autistic Children.[11][12] In 2016, Roescheisen began working on the project _The Exit Fairytale of Suicide_ to raise suicide awareness in collaboration with the German organization Freunde fürs Leben.
