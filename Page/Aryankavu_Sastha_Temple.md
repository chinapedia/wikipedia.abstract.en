ARYANKAVU SASTHA TEMPLE a Hindu temple and one among the 108 Sastha shrines in the Indian state of Kerala. The idol here is believed to be consecrated by sage Parashurama.[1] It is also one among _Pancha Sastha_ temples in Kerala located in the Pathanapuram tehsil of Kollam district, in the eastern forest ranges.


Temple

The _pratishta_ here is quite different from that of Achankovil, Kulthupuzha and Sabarimala temples. Ayyappa is depicted as a young boy sitting on an elephant with right leg hanging and left leg being in a folded position, along with his consort _Prabha_ on the left side and Lord Shiva on the right.[2] As in Sabarimala, the temple too have 18 steps. The temple built in the traditional architectural styles of both Kerala and Tamil Nadu preserves several murals of Hindu deities. Another feature of the temple is that it is built 35 feet below the road level. The Poojas and rituals conducted in the temple is very much similar to the Tamil traditions as it is located near the border of two states.


Behind the name
