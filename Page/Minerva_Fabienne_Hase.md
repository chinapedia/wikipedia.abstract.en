Personal life

Hase was born on 10 June 1999 in Berlin.[1] She studied at the Schul- und Leistungssportzentrum in Berlin.[2]


Career

Single skating

Hase began learning to skate in 2004.[3] She skated internationally in the novice ranks until the end of 2013. In January 2016, she finished 5th in the junior ladies' category at the German Youth Championships.

2014–2015 season: First season in pairs

Hase teamed up with Nolan Seegert in 2014. The pair's international debut came in late November, at the 2014 NRW Trophy, where they took the bronze medal. In January 2015, they took bronze at the MNNT Cup before competing at the 2015 European Championships in Stockholm, Sweden; they placed 11th in the short program, 10th in the free skate, and 10th overall. They concluded their first season with bronze at the International Challenge Cup.

2015–2016 season

Making their ISU Challenger Series debut, Hase/Seegert placed 6th at the 2015 CS Nebelhorn Trophy. They then won gold at the 2015 NRW Trophy and finished 6th at the 2015 CS Tallinn Trophy. They received silver at the 2016 Sarajevo Open and at the 2016 Bavarian Open.

2016–2017 season

In November, Hase/Seegert won gold at the 2016 NRW Trophy and bronze at the 2016 CS Warsaw Cup. The following month, they competed at the German Championships but withdrew following the short program due to an injury to Hase.[4]

In January, Hase/Seegert skated at the 2017 MNNT Cup, placing 4th, and then at the 2017 European Championships in Ostrava; they finished 12th overall in the Czech Republic after placing 13th in the short program and 12th in the free skate. In March, the pair took bronze at the 2017 Cup of Tyrol before competing at the 2017 World Championships in Helsinki, Finland. They achieved a personal best short program score, 59.76 points, but their ranking (19th) was insufficient to advance to the final segment.

2017–2018 season

In October, Hase/Seegert finished 8th at the 2017 CS Finlandia Trophy and 4th at the 2017 CS Minsk-Arena Ice Star. They outscored Annika Hocke / Ruben Blommaert by 5.77 points for the bronze medal at the 2017 CS Warsaw Cup in November. The following month, the pair won silver behind Aliona Savchenko / Bruno Massot at the German Championships, ranking second in both segments and obtaining 4.33 points more than Hocke/Blommaert.[5] Hase/Seegert were not included in Germany's team to the 2018 Winter Olympics, having finished third overall in the national qualification standings.[6]

Due to a back injury sustained by Hase, the pair was unable to accept a spot at the 2018 European Championships, which became available after Savchenko/Massot withdrew.[7]

2018–2019 season

After the missed chance to participate at 2018 Winter Olympics as well as after almost survived health problems, Hase/Seegert started the new competition season at the 2018 CS Nebelhorn Trophy and finished 4th.[8] Then, in late July 2018, the pair received their first Grand Prix invitations to compete at the 2018 Skate America and 2018 Internationaux de France;[9] the results were places 5[10] and 7[11]. After participating at the 2018 Golden Spin of Zagreb with the 4th place,[12] they were able to achieve an important success by winning the 2019 German Championships,[13] after they had to admit defeat to Savchenko/Massot last year; their only competitors at that were Hocke/Blommaert, since Savchenko/Massot officially took a one-year break after the 2018 World Championships.[14]

Hase/Seegert then recorded continuation of increase in their performance – at the 2019 European Championships they took 6th with a total score of 180.56 points,[15] and at the 2019 Challenge Cup they won gold at their first international competition with a new best total score of 185.38 points.[16][17]

After the announcement of the German Ice Skating Union, Hase/Seegert and the second German pair Hocke/Blommaert will compete at the 2019 World Championships in Saitama/Japan.[18]
