In 2017, Cassandra and Paul Hetherington signed an advance contract with Princeton University Press to write a book on prose poetry.[18]

Themes

Atherton’s prose poetry explores the reanimation of canonical texts against a backdrop of popular culture references.[19] She appeals to humour noir and the politicisation of the poet’s private spaces.[20] Geoff Page writes: "Though many of the poems are anecdotal they also advance by sound associations and other aleatory devices. They tend to be seriously playful with a bent towards the satirical, even the self-mocking."[21]

Critical response

Atherton is praised for her prose poetry, and is likened to masters of the form. Michael Farrell writes: "Cassandra Atherton’s nervy style is distinct from an earlier generation of prose poets (Joanne Burns, Gary Catalano, Ania Walwicz); it feels both post-punk and post-John Forbes."[22] While others, such as Chloe Wilson, have praised her for exploring the fundamental question of any poet: "They are works in which the speaker, moving back and forth between text and experience, continually asks an unanswerable question: ‘How do I write the space between my heart and my pen?'"[23] While Atherton's prose poetry is informed by previous poets and investigates the anxiety of the artist, Ivy Ireland has observed dark humour in her collection of prose poetry, _Exhumed_: "Dazzling, vibrant and terribly witty, ... _Exhumed_ does not give itself over entirely to the horribly serious, gruesome images invoked by its title."[24] Australian writer Kerryn Goldsworthy notes in a critique of Atherton's _Trace_ (2015) that "The dense, intense prose is often funny, and incorporates all kinds of cultural allusions."[25]


Collaboration

Atherton most often collaborates with artist and writer Phil Day and scholar and poet, Paul Hetherington. She is currently engaged in collaborating on Sketch Notes 4 and 5 with Day and a series of artist's books with both Hetherington and Day.

She was awarded a VicArts Grant (2016)[26] to collaborate on writing a prose poetry graphic novel with Day and scholar/poet Alyson Miller, titled _Pika-don_.
