The CATHEDRAL OF THE CONSOLATA,[1][2] also called the ROMAN CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL OF TEHRAN, is a Catholic Church building in the city of Tehran, Iran, in which the Latin or Roman rite is followed.[3][4] It is not to be confused with the Chaldean Catholic cathedral of Tehran, St. Joseph's Cathedral, where the Chaldean rite is followed.

The cathedral is located near the Italian embassy in Tehran and Neauphle-le-Ch√¢teau Street. It is the main church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ispahan (_Archidioecesis Hispahanensis Latinorum_), which was created in 1629 by Pope Urban VIII.

It is under the pastoral responsibility of Bishop Sarkis Davidian. Due to the diversity of nationalities of Christians in the city, it offers religious services in various languages.
