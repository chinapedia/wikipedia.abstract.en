AGHNASKEAGH CAIRNS is a chambered cairn and portal tomb forming a National Monument in County Louth, Ireland.[1][2][3]


Location

Aghnaskeagh Cairns are located south of Slieve Foy, to the west of the N1.[4][5]


History and archaeology

The two cairns may have been connected by a gallery.

Portal tomb

The northern cairn is a dolmen (portal tomb) with the capstone missing. Two portal stones (2.8 m / 9Â ft high) and a back stone remain. Six Bronze Age cist burials were later added. Archeologists found potsherds, cremated bone, food vessels and a blue glass bead on the site, as well as the remains of blackberries under one of the cists, presumably as grave-goods.[6]

Chambered cairn

The southern cairn is a chambered cairn with four cists at the eastern end. Excavations revealed cremated bone, potsherds and scrapers. A burial was also made here in the early Christian era. [7][8][9]
