_GILMORE GIRLS: A YEAR IN THE LIFE_ is an American web television series on the streaming service Netflix. It is a sequel to _Gilmore Girls_, an American dramedy television series created by Amy Sherman-Palladino and starring Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel.

The miniseries sees the return of Sherman-Palladino and her husband Daniel Palladino to the series after leaving prior to season 7. The series consisted of four 88- to 102-minute episodes, which were released on November 25, 2016. Each episode follows the characters through one of the four seasons.


Synopsis

Due to her frequent travels as a freelance journalist, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) gives up her apartment in favor of staying at her friends' homes in New York, Stars Hollow, and London. In London, Rory stays with Logan Huntzberger (Matt Czuchry) while working on a book for the eccentric Naomi Shropshire (Alex Kingston). Rory and Logan are in a no strings attached relationship, although Logan is engaged and Rory has a boyfriend named Paul, though she never remembers him. When Naomi fires her and Logan's fiancée moves in, Rory struggles with her lack of a career and her relationship with Logan. She meets with Jess Mariano (Milo Ventimiglia), who encourages her to write her own book about her life with her mother.

Emily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop) grieves the recent death of her husband and tricks her daughter Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) into starting therapy with her. Lorelai has also been feeling lost due to the death of her father, the career progressions of her long-time business partners, and her relationship with Luke Danes (Scott Patterson). Lorelai and Luke have been dating for over ten years but have yet to marry or discuss children. They consider using a surrogate, and attend a fertility clinic where Paris works. After fighting with Rory about the book idea, Lorelai spontaneously leaves home to hike the Pacific Crest Trail in the manner of _Wild_.

Emily eventually accepts her husband's death, sells their home, effectively quits the DAR, and moves to Nantucket, single and independent for the first time in her life. Despite never actually hiking, Lorelai returns from her trip, reconciles with Emily and Rory, and asks Luke to marry her. Rory visits her father, Christopher Hayden (David Sutcliffe), to inform him of the wedding. She asks him why he allowed Lorelai to raise her as a single mother and they agree that it turned out for the best. Luke and Lorelai marry in the gazebo and, in the final scene of the series, Rory reveals to Lorelai that she is pregnant.

Development

On September 15, 2010, Lauren Graham told _Vanity Fair_ that a _Gilmore Girls_ movie is a definite possibility: "people with power, people who could actually make it happen, are talking about it."[1][2] She stated the same thing in March 2013 through her Twitter account in the wake of companion show _Veronica Mars_ earning Kickstarter funding for their film, saying it would be Sherman-Palladino's call for a film.[3]

On June 11, 2012, while being interviewed for her new show _Bunheads_, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino reflected on the contract dispute and her own departure in an interview with Vulture, saying: "It was a botched negotiation. It really was about the fact that I was working too much. I was going to be the crazy person who was locked in my house and never came out. I heard a lot of 'Amy doesn't need a writing staff because she and [her husband] Dan Palladino write everything!' I thought, _That's a great mentality on your part, but if you want to keep the show going for two more years, let me hire more writers_. By the way, all this shit we asked for? They had to do [it] anyway when we left. They hired this big writing staff and a producer-director onstage. That's what bugged me the most. They wound up having to do what we'd asked for anyway, and I wasn't there."[4]

In May 2015, in an interview on the _Gilmore Guys_ podcast, Scott Patterson said: "There are talks going on at the moment. I can't really go into any detail, but there is some activity. So I'm hopeful, and you know, I'm in. [...] I think there's a lot of territory left unexplored that we could explore in a limited series or a TV movie or feature film, whatever that may be. I think it really just comes down to the script. I think everybody would jump on board."[5] At the June 2015 ATX Television Festival in Austin, Texas, the cast reunited with creator Amy Sherman-Palladino where she told the audience, "I'm sorry, there's nothing in the works at the moment."[6]

In October 2015, it was reported on TVLine that Netflix struck a deal with Warner Bros. to revive the series in a limited run, consisting of four 90-minute episodes.[7][8] It was reported that Sherman-Palladino would be in charge of the new episodes.[9] In April 2016, Sherman-Palladino said that the 90-minute format was inspired by the series _Sherlock_, of which she is a fan: "They’re their own mini-movies. It felt like a format that would work well for us on a storytelling level".[10]

On October 25, 2015, during a Wizard World Tulsa pop culture convention Q&A, Milo Ventimiglia stated, "I've always been pretty vocal about _Gilmore_ and I know everybody's been waiting, and I was like, 'That will never happen,' and it's totally happening. While I was actually here, I got an email from the producers. Again, I'm always vocal (about producers) Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino; they're two of my favorite people and two of my favorite writers ever of all time. Just to be able to speak their words again, of course I would do it. So I told them, yeah, of course I'll do it."[11]

On January 29, 2016, Netflix and Warner Bros. officially confirmed the revival, tentatively titled _Gilmore Girls: Seasons_.[12] Filming of the new episodes had started in Los Angeles as of February 2, 2016, and was scheduled to last until June 30, 2016,[13] with Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino returning as writers and directors.[14] On May 19, 2016, it was announced that the revival would be titled _Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life_.[15]

Producer Gavin Polone, who was involved in the original series as an executive producer with talent manager Judy Hofflund under their defunct Hofflund-Polone banner, sued Warner Bros. Television for a credit on the miniseries and additional payments for his early involvement in the original series (Hofflund retired from the business in 2013 and pursued no credits).[16][17] Polone ultimately played no role in the miniseries and was uncredited when it was released. David S. Rosenthal, who took over as showrunner for Sherman-Palladino in the last season, also had no involvement in _A Year in the Life_.
