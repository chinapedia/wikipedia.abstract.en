The LOUISIADE WHISTLER (_Pachycephala collaris_) is a species of bird in the family Pachycephalidae, which is endemic to the Louisiade Archipelago south-east of New Guinea. It was split from the Bismarck whistler by the IOC in 2015.[1]


Taxonomy and systematics

It has been variably considered a subspecies of a widespread golden whistler (_P. pectoralis_) or treated as a separate species, but strong published evidence in favour of either treatment is limited, and further study is warranted to resolve the complex taxonomic situation.[2]

Subspecies

Two subspecies are recognized:[3]

-   _P. c. collaris_ - Ramsay, 1878: Found in the Louisiade Archipelago except Rossel Island
-   _P. c. rosseliana_ - Hartert, 1898: Originally described as a separate species. Found on Rossel Island (Louisiade Archipelago)
