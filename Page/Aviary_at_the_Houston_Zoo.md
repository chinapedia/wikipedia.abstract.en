The AVIARY AT THE HOUSTON ZOO is a historic work of art created by Dionicio Rodriguez located at the Houston Zoo in Houston, Texas and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[1] The Faux Bios sculptures were built in 1926 and dubbed the "flying sculpture." Although Hurricane Carla destroyed the aviary's wire superstructure in 1961, Rodriquez's sculptures remain and are composed of a tree, a fountain, logs, ledges and rock bordering a shallow pond which are now part of the Flamingo Habitat at the zoo.[2][3]
