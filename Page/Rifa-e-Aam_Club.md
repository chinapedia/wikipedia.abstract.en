The RIFA-E-AAM CLUB (, ) is a historic building in Lucknow, India. It is best known as the place where the Progressive Writers Movement was created.[1][2]


History

The building was constructed around 1860 by the Nawab of Awadh, who intended it to be a centre of the royalty's literary life in the region.[3][4] According to a local historian, the name derived from "_rifa_" or "happiness" and "_aam_" or "common", and suggested that the club offered happiness to the common man.[5][6] The club was open to everybody, and was thus a symbol of rebellion against local British clubs, which did not permit Indians to enter.[7] In subsequent years it became what _The Economist_ described as "an important nationalist hangout".[8] It was one of the centres of nationalist, anti-British intellectual activity, frequented by individuals such as Munshi Premchand and Mohammad Amir Ahmad Khan.[9] In the 1900s it hosted meetings of the All-India Muslim League.[10] The club hosted a meeting of the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League which led to the Lucknow Pact of 1916, which was also signed on the premises.[11][12] Mahatma Gandhi visited the building to give a speech on Hindu-Muslim unity on 15 October 1920[13][14][15] and on 26 April 1922 Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel made speeches at the club encouraging local people to intensify the Swadeshi movement.[16] The Progressive Writers Movement was created in 10 April 1936.[17]

The building has not been well maintained in the decades since; one wing has become a hospital, another has been abandoned, and the courtyard is a rubbish dump.[18][19][20] The poor state of the building has led to local activism trying to get it recognized and protected as a heritage landmark by the government.[21][22][23][24]
