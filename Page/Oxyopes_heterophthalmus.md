_OXYOPES HETEROPHTHALMUS_ is a lynx spider from the family Oxyopidae, it is the type species of the genus _Oxyopes_ and was described by Pierre Andr√© Latreille in 1804, it has a Palearctic distribution.[1]


Description

The palps of the male have a dorsally directed patellar apophysis, which is nearly as long as male's palpal tibia. The epigyne has a reddish-brown median part, and is broadly rounded anteriorly. The body colour is dark brown, with a whitish pattern on the dorsum. The legs are black, with bright hairs and strikingly robust spines. Both sexes are in length.[2] Their abdomen is roughly triangular in shape and ends in a point.[3]


Biology

_Oxyopes heterophthalmus_ is a long legged, diurnal[4] hunting spider which is capable of running very fast and jumping on their prey in a similar fashion to a cat, leading to their common name of lynx spider. They do not utilise webs to catch prey. Their eyesight is not as good as that of the jumping spiders but they can see their prey from a distance of up to .[5] In Great Britain adults occur in late May and June.[6] The female spins a cocoon which is attached to a plant, she guards this until the eggs hatch.[7]


Habitat

_Oxyopes heterophthalmus_ is normally found in mature dry heathland.[8] It has a preference for heather and other low shrubs.[9]


Distribution

_Oxyopes heterophthalmus_ has a Palearctic distribution.[10] In Europe it is found in Central and Southern Europe, and is more common to the south.[11] In Great Britain it is confined to a few sites in southern England.[12]
