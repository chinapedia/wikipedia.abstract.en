FILM CRITICS CIRCLE OF INDIA (FCCI) is a society comprising notable film critics from all the major film producing states of India.[2][3][4]

At the AGM, conducted at the International Film Festival of India—2013, Subhash Ghai said, "You are in a highly responsible profession. You have the responsibility to look into the growth of civilization and of the next generation. We filmmakers look upon you as God. So guide us in your reviews, tell us where we lack, and how we can improve. But do not mock us. Creative people are extra sensitive, so talk like a mother, not like an opponent."[5]

ALIIFF-2016: IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON CRITICS [11]

Baradwaj Rangan: "Social media has taken away the aspect of word-of-mouth and has kind of separated it from film criticism, which is, I think, the best thing that has ever happened, because, far too often, people mistake film criticism from something that should tell them whether or not they should go watch a film."

Mayank Shekhar: "As Baradwaj pointed out, film criticism has various approaches - historical, social... The journalistic approach has traditionally been about newly-released films. The reader basically just wants to know if the reviewer at the end of the day liked the film or not."

IFFI-2014: DOES TECHNOLOGY KILL GOOD CINEMA AND SENSITIVITY? [12]

M.K. Raghavendra: "Kubrick’s futuristic masterpiece '2001: A Space Odyssey' was made in 1968. In the last forty-six years nobody has made a film with a similarly profound influence on how we think, despite the revolutionary changes in technology. Emotions do not need fresh technology, and some stories are never remade".

Rashmi Doraiswamy: "Films today are shot and edited non-linearly; even a piece of music is recorded non-continuously, with stops between each line of singing. Original is no more relevant in this synthetic culture of packaged entertainment. Reality and technology both are fragmented to today’s connected generation, influencing each other".

Ashok Rane: "In an industry where the producers want to use magic technologies without even thinking about story, plot or characters, technology is doing more harm than benefit. There is a growing tendency where even low budget films try to use chroma and multi-point tracking, most of the time in pathetic ways".
