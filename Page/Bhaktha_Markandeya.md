_BHAKTA MARKANDEYA_ is an Indian Tamil language mythological film directed by B. S. Ranga with Chittor V. Nagaiah, Pushpavalli, K. A. Thangavelu and Padmini Priyadarshini in the lead roles. The film was released in 1957.[1][2]


Plot

The theme of the story is to nullify the powers of Yama (God of Death) by Lord Shiva.

Lord Shiva blesses sage Mrukanda Maharshi and his wife with a child. The child, Markandeya, was given a lease of 16 years to live in this world. But the child worships Lord Shiva with unlimited Bhakthi (devotion). When he completes 16 years of age, Yama comes to take his life as appointed. Markandeya grips the Shivalinga and Lord Shiva appears before Yama and tells him not to take Markandeya's life as he (Lord Shiva) has blessed the boy. So, Markandeya becomes an immortal. The moral of the story is that one who surrenders to God need not worry about death.
