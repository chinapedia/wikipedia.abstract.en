He was educated in Kelly College, Tavistock and Queen's college, University of Oxford.[1] McArthur was appointed in 1895 in London after an open competition to Hong Kong and Strait Settlements civil service (later known as Malayan civil service).[2] He was dispatched to Brunei to make recommendations about the structure of the administration for the "dying sultanate".
