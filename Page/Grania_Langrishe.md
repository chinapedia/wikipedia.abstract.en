GRANIA SYBIL ENID, LADY LANGRISHE (born 1934), is an Irish botanical illustrator and artist.[1]


Life

Born Grania Sybil Enid Wingfield on 25 April 1934 to the Right Honourable The 9th Viscount Powerscourt (he succeeded to the peerage in March 1947) and Sheila Claude Beddington.[2][3] She married Sir Hercules Ralph Hume Langrishe, 7th Baronet, on 21 April 1955. The couple had four children, the youngest of whom is the artist Atalanta Pollock.[4][5][6]

Though she grew up at the Powerscourt Estate, her mother, Lady Powerscourt, moved the family to Bermuda for a while during her childhood. This inspired her lifelong fascination with plants. Although Langrishe had no formal training, she began painting botanical illustrations in watercolour. Langrishe was elected to the Watercolour Society of Ireland in 1984.[7] Lady Langrishe regularly exhibits with the Watercolour Society.[8][9] Her work was commissioned for two books on trees and plants in Ireland.

Lady Langrishe lives at Arlonstown, Dunsany, County Meath.[10]
