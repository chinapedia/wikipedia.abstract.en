_THE GOLDEN TURKEY AWARDS_ is a 1980 book by film critic Michael Medved and his brother Harry.


About

The book awards "Golden Turkey Awards" to films judged by the authors as poor in quality, and to directors and actors judged to have created a chronically inept body of work. The book features many low-budget obscurities and exploitation films such as _Rat Pfink a Boo Boo_, _Attack of the 50 Foot Woman_, and the apparently lost _Him_. Other categories include expensive, big studio failures like _The Swarm_ and popular films such as _Jesus Christ Superstar_.

In the introduction the authors admit that "we know our choices will not please everyone—least of all the actors, producers, writers and directors who are honored in the pages that follow. We further recognize that the number of bad films is so enormous and the competition for the very worst is so intense, that all decisions reached here are subject to considerable second-guessing. Nevertheless, we have researched the subject thoroughly—sitting through more than 2,000 wretched films in the last few years—and we believe that our nominees and award winners can stand the test of time."

The Medveds had previously celebrated bad cinema in _The Fifty Worst Films of All Time_, many of which were also featured in the various _Golden Turkey Awards_ categories. Subsequently, they turned their attention to box office bombs in _The Hollywood Hall of Shame_. They also published a sequel to _The Golden Turkey Awards_, _Son of Golden Turkey Awards,_ in 1986. They declared that _Son of Golden Turkey Awards_ "is our last word...we hereby solemnly pledge that the years ahead will produce no further Golden Turkey publications by the Medved Brothers...we now pass the torch to whichever brave souls feel ready to take up the challenge." _Son of Golden Turkey Awards_ also listed a "Who's Who in the World of Bad Movies" at the end of its awards presentations.

The Golden Turkey Awards formed the basis of a 1983 television series _The Worst of Hollywood_ hosted by Michael Medved.


Awards given

In the book _The Fifty Worst Films of All Time_ the authors invited readers to write in nominating their favorite "worst films". More than 3,000 ballots were received. Based on these votes, the Worst Film of All Time award was given to _Plan 9 from Outer Space_ by Ed Wood.

Wood is also awarded the title of Worst Director of All Time, judged by the authors. Raquel Welch is judged the Worst Actress of All Time over nominees including Candice Bergen and Mamie van Doren.

Richard Burton is judged as the Worst Actor of All Time over nominees John Agar, Tony Curtis and Victor Mature. While conceding he is sometimes brilliant, the authors claim Burton's "occasional triumphs only serve to highlight the pathetic waste in most of his films; for every _Equus_ in which he appears there are at least a half-dozen _Cleopatra_s or _Boom!_s. The authors state that "when he is bad ... well, he's just the pits" and list several "bad" films in which he has appeared: _The Sandpiper_, _Hammersmith Is Out_, _The Voyage_, _The Medusa Touch_ and _The Assassination of Trotsky_. Another Burton film, _Exorcist II: The Heretic_, is the book's first runner up in the Worst Film of All Time award based on reader response.

Hoax film

One of the films nominated in the book was in fact an invention of the authors, and readers were challenged to figure out which film was actually fake. The fake film was _Dog of Norway_ featuring "Muki the Wonder Hound". This film was illustrated using a photo of a co-author's dog. The giveaway was that the same dog was in the photo of the authors in the back of the book. Another film in the book, the now-lost 1974 porn film _Him_, has also been cited as the hoax, though it is known to have existed.[1]

No formal clarification of the hoax film was provided by the subsequent release, _The Hollywood Hall of Shame_. That book again features the same dog pictured with the authors (as did the subsequent _Son of Golden Turkey Awards_). In _The Hollywood Hall of Shame_, in reference to the dish barbecued dog, the authors explain that it was "a snack which produced a mixed reaction among the representatives of an industry that had given the world Lassie, Rin Tin Tin, Benji, Phyllis Diller, and Muki the Wonder Hound."[2]

The "Acknowledgements" page of _The Fifty Worst Films of All Time_ ends with:



        And love, most of all, to Muki, who was there to understand when the going got rough.
