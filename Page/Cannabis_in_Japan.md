CANNABIS IN JAPAN has been illegal since 1948. Use and possession are punishable by up to five years' imprisonment and a fine. Cultivation, sale, and transport are punishable by up to 7 to 10 years' imprisonment and a fine.[1]


History

Ancient history

Cannabis has been cultivated in Japan since the pre-Neolithic period, for its fibres and as a food source, and possibly as a psychoactive material.[2] While archaeological evidence supports the use of cannabis as a textile (hemp), there is no conclusive archaeological evidence for its medicinal use.

The Japanese term for hemp, TAIMA, is derived from the Chinese term _ta m√†_.[3]

Cannabis Control Law (1948)

The Cannabis Control Law was first developed in 1930, with modifications made in 1947, 1948, and 1963.[4] The 1948 law adopted a licensing system for dealers, and punishments for unlicensed use or sale.[5]

Popularization

Cannabis began to gain some favor as a drug in Japan in the 1970s as incomes rose, but remained less popular (including among youth) than amphetamines.[6] In 1972, there were 1,460 cases of narcotics crime, and 853 cases of violation of the Cannabis Control Law.[7]


Supply

Most cannabis consumed in Japan is imported from other countries; some illicit cultivation sites were found in Japan in 2009, but most of them were small.[8] In a notable exception, in 2016 a raid in Wakayama Prefecture seized over 10,000 plants, which police deemed an "extraordinary amount" compared to past raids.[9]


Cannabis Museum

The Taima Hakubutsukan was established in Nasu, Tochigi Prefecture, in 2001, by cannabis historian Junichi Takayasu.[10]
