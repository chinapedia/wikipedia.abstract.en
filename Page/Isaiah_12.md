ISAIAH 12 is the twelfth chapter of the Book of Isaiah in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet Isaiah, and is a part of the Book of the Prophets.[1] The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges describes this chapter as "the lyrical epilogue to the first great division of the book (chapters 1–12)".[2]


Text

The original text was written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 6 verses and consists of two short hymns of praise.[3]

-   Protestant theologian Heinrich Ewald argued that these songs contain little of the distinctive language used elsewhere by Isaiah and was probably a later addition to the book.[4]

Textual witnesses

Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew language:

-   Masoretic Text (10th century)
-   Dead Sea Scrolls:
    -   1QIsa^(a): complete
    -   1QIsa^(b): extant: verses 3‑4, 6
    -   4QIsa^(a) (4Q55): extant: verses 4‑6

    -   4QIsa^(l) (4Q65): extant: verses 1‑4, 6

There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; 𝔊^(B); 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: 𝔊^(S); 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; 𝔊^(A); 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; 𝔊^(Q); 6th century).


Parashot

The _parashah_ sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.[5] Isaiah 12 is a part of the _Prophecies about Judah and Israel (Isaiah 1–12)_. {P}: open _parashah_; {S}: closed _parashah_.

    [{P} 11:11-16] 12:1-6 {S}


Verse 2

    _Behold, God is my salvation,_

        ''I will trust and not be afraid;

    ''‘For Yah, the Lord, is my strength and song;

        _He also has become my salvation.’_[6]

Hebrew (Masoretic text)

    הנה אל ישועתי אבטח ולא אפחד כי־עזי וזמרת יה יהוה ויהי־לי לישועה׃

Transliteration:

    hi·neh EL ye·shu·'a·ti eb·takh we·lo eph·khad

        ki-a·zi we·zim·rat YAH YHWH way·hi-li li·shu·'ah.

-   "Yah, the Lord" (יה יהוה, Y(A)H Y(E)H(O)W(A)H) the repetition of God's holy name emphasizes that the salvation of Israel does not come from other nations but only from God, who always keeps His covenant with the people of Israel.[7]
