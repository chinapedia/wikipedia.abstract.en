SECULARIZATION is the confiscation of church land or property by the state. The term is often used to specifically refer to such confiscations during the French Revolution and the First French Empire, either in the sense of seizing churches and converting their property to state ownership or in the sense of incorporating ecclesiastical principalities and territories of the former Holy Roman Empire into larger secular territorial states.
