DÍYÁ'U'LLÁH (alternate spelling: Zíyá'u'lláh) (15 August 1864 - 30 October 1898) was one of the sons of Bahá'u'lláh. He was the second son of his father's second wife Fatimih (also known as Mahd-i-'Ulya). He was born in Edirne (modern day Adrianople).[1][2]

Bahá'u'lláh gave the title _Ghusn-i-Athar_ (meaning "Most Pure Branch" or "Purer Branch") to his son Mírzá Mihdí.[3] After Mírzá Mihdí's death in 1870, Bahá'u'lláh gave the same title to his other son Díyá'u'lláh,[4] but this is not confirmed by Bahá'í sources.[5][6]

He swayed between his two brothers, `Abdu'l-Bahá and Muhammad `Alí, in their argument. He married Thurayyá Samandarí, daughter of Shaykh Kázim-i-Samandar and sister of Taráz’u’lláh Samandarí, a Hand of the Cause of God. The marriage was childless. Díyá'u'lláh died on 30 October 1898 in Haifa Palestine, and was posthumously labeled a Covenant-breaker.[7][8]

After his death in 1898, Díyá'u'lláh was initially buried next to his father at the Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh at the Mansion of Bahjí. However, having been declared a Covenant-breaker, Díyá'u'lláh's remains were disinterred in 1965 in a process the Universal House of Justice described as a "purification... from past contamination."[9]
