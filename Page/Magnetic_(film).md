Critical response

Magnetic has received primarily mixed-to-positive reviews, with most finding the movie challenging and noting the narrative ambiguity and complexity.

Daniel XIII of Famous Monsters of Filmland wrote, “The best way I can get you into the mindset of MAGNETIC is to say, what if instead of Lewis Carroll, 80s-era Gary Numan wrote Alice in Wonderland on an absinthe binge while covered in magnetic tape surrounded by a complete run of Jack Kirby’s 2001 comics. Sounds strange, right? Well, the movie is 100 times more insane, in the most f’n glorious way possible!”[8] Wicked Channel rated the movie 8/10 stating, "The best way to describe this film is, a controlled insanity. I love when people do not follow convention, and these two seem to diving in that deep pool a lot."[9] Mike Snoonian of Film Thrills also praised the film, saying, "...managed to harness a phenomenal performance out of their lead and turn in a thought provoking and reflective examination on our need for intimacy. It’s a challenging work, but a rewarding one for the viewer that sticks with it."[10]

Jeff Berkwits of Sci Fi Magazine wrote, “…as with The Prisoner, those who stick with the tale will be richly rewarded.”[11]

Peter Wong of Beyond Chron found some positive elements, but in an overall mixed response, noted, "some viewers’ heads will understandably explode in confusion."[12]

Way Too Indie also gave a mixed response, "There’s no question the filmmakers recognize catchy beats, or that they can create a stylish, moody atmosphere. But constructing complex sci-fi ideas into an engaging low-budget thriller may have been a little too ambitious."[13]

The most negative review came from Next Projection, "The story is too complicated to rely on so little structure, bringing in a mishmash of elements that struggle to communicate with one another."[14]


Other media

The film is one of the main subjects of the book, Indie Science Fiction Cinema Today: Conversations with 21st Century Filmmakers[15] and an image from the film is on the cover of the book. The authors further analyze the film: "Using a single lead character to stand in as every individual human being in the world, _Magnetic_ is an audacious and surreal journey. Extrapolating long-held fears of societal breakdown and imminent destruction that surface in times of rapid human advancement or global tragedy, the film's visual flair and stream-of-consciousness narrative turn these fears into intensely personal elements."
