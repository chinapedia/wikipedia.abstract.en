The HAKLA–DERA ISMAIL KHAN MOTORWAY (), also known as the BRAHMA BAHTAR–YARIK MOTORWAY, is a four-lane North-South motorway currently under-construction in Pakistan. The motorway is being developed as part of the Western Alignment of the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor,[1][2] and will offer high speed road connections between the Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area, and the southern parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province around Dera Ismail Khan.


Route

Groundbreaking ceremony took place in May 2016. The four-lane controlled access motorway will extend from the Hakla Interchange on the M1 Motorway, near Fateh Jang in Punjab, to Dera Ismail Khan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[3]

From Hakla, Fateh Jang, the motorway will extend in a southwestern direction passing the towns of Pindi Gheb, Tarap, and Mianwali. The route will transverse the Sindh Sagar Doab region, and cross the Indus River near Mianwali before entering into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The motorway will continue on wards before terminating near the town of Yarik, just north of Dera Ismail Khan.[4]

At the southern terminus of the new Hakla-Dera Ismail Khan motorway, the N50 National Highway will also be upgraded between Dera Ismail Khan-Zhob and between Zhob-Quetta.[5]


Specifications

The expressway / motorway includes provision of 11 interchanges, 19 flyovers (6 lanes), 15 bridges (4 lane), 74 underpasses, 259 culverts, and three major bridges (6 lane); one at River Sawan, one at River Indus and third at River Koram. The expressway will have a 100m wide right of way in order to widen the four lane road to six lanes in future.[6]
