ACCRA GIRLS SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL is an all female second cycle institution in Accra in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana.[1][2][3] and operates as a non-denominational day and boarding school. The school runs courses in business, general science, general arts, home economics and visual arts, leading to the award of a West African Senior High School Certificate (WASSCE).[4]


Establishment

Accra Girls Senior High School was established in 1960 as one of the Ghana Education Trust Schools. The history of the Ghana Education Trust Schools dates back to the 1950s and 1960s which marked a period of self-governance in administration under the distinguished leadership of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah. There were only few schools and as a result a few educated people in the country; a situation which did not befit our status as a country. It was therefore crucial to expand education with the sole aim of producing people who will live commendable and morally upright lives while serving the manpower needs of the nation for national development. Government therefore introduced the Accelerated Development Plan of Education to increase the infrastructure of the Government assisted schools. To achieve this aim, _the Education trust_ was established. This fund was used to establish a number of primary and secondary schools, one of which was Accra Girls Senior High School. The school commenced on the 30th September, 1960 under the headship of Miss Blanch Gibson, an expatriate. In a months time, the school which began with an initial twelve (12) students had increased to forty-two (42) and eventually seventy-five (75) and five (5) teachers namely Miss Lena Beale, Miss Mercer, Mrs. Paulina Buckman, Mrs. Irene Darkwah and Mrs. Blanche Gibson. Over the years, the school has seen a tremendous increase in the number of both staff and students. In the fifty six years of existence, the school has carved a niche for itself by maintaining enviable academic excellence, progress and a high level of discipline. Irrespective of the scanty material and human resource available, the school has made a conscious effort to mobilize these resource in order to achieve higher heights.


School crest

The pioneering staff of the school are credited with the design of the school crest. The crest is made up of an eagle, a book and a pen which indicates that students are expected to be sharp sighted, keen and enduring in their academic work. The motto "AIM HIGH" implies that the sky should be the limit for students in their academic pursuit and never to pave way for mediocrity or complacency.


Heads of Accra Girls SHS

Mrs Blanch Gibson left the school at the end of the first year and Mrs Barbara Oddoye and Marjorie Bulley, in succession, took over the administration of the school for the second year. In 1962, Mrs. Gloria Aryee became the headmistress and was succeeded by Mrs. Beatrice Sey in 1979 who acted for three (3) years. Mrs. Kate Cobbinah was the next headmistress and she was succeeded by Miss Bertha Clottey in 1995.
