GEORGE DOUGLAS (_c_. 1540[1]-1587) was one of the Eighty-five martyrs of England and Wales.[2] Born in Edinburgh, he was originally a teacher by profession.[3]

Converting to Catholicism, he travelled to France around 1556[4] where he was ordained a secular priest[5] in Notre Dame, Paris, in 1574- possibly at the testimonial of Mary, Queen of Scots.[6] Returning to the north of England, he was a priest in York,[7] where it seems he was 'apparelled in course canvas dublit and hose,' and in the East Midlands as well.[8] Captured and found guilty in York of 'persuading the Queen's subjects away' from Protestantism,[9] he was executed on 9 September 1587.[10]

He was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 22 November 1987.[11]
