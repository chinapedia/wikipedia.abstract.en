Early life

He joined the 4th Indian Division in Italy and fought at Castle Hill during the Battle of Monte Cassino.[5] Later in the Italian campaign, at midnight on 3 September 1944, Smith led Letter C company, 2nd Battalion, the 7th Gurkha Rifles in the attack on Tavoleto, on the Gothic Line, which was heavily defended. The Gurkhas attack was met by heavy enemy machine gun fire and later a heavy mortar barrage. Smith although wounded in the leg, killed all the occupants of the first Spandau post encountered with grenades and machine-gun fire; he continued to lead his company which during the fierce fighting was reduced from approximately 100 men to 28 and successfully cleared the village. He was awarded the DSO for his leadership and gallantry whilst wounded during the attack.[10][6]

During the amputation he was fully conscious.[14] He was later taken by another helicopter to Kuching for further surgery.[15] He remained in Borneo and a year after the helicopter crash took over command of the 1st/2nd Gurkhas.[16][17] He remained in command of the 1st/2nd Gurkhas following their move to Hong Kong.[18]
