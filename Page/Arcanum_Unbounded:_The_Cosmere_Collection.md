Reception

_Publishers Weekly_ called the collection required reading for fans of Sanderson's work and noted that it also offers a lot to readers who are undaunted by learning a lot.[4] _Kirkus Reviews_ wrote that many of the stories were "good...with all the quick wit, richly detailed settings, and memorable characters fans have come to expect from this prolific writer." However, they also stated that some of the stories lacked solid character building and felt "more like deleted scenes".[5]
