Biography

Fx Goby studied animation at Supinfocom, a pioneer school in Computer animation in Valenciennes. He graduated in 2006 with a short animated film _En Tus Brazos_, co directed with Edouard Jouret and Matthieu Landour, that toured festivals around the world[1] and won awards, including a Siggraph 2007 Award of Excellence.[2]

After living in Paris for three years he moved to London joining Nexus Productions. He formed the directing duo Fx and Mat with university friend Matthieu Landour and directed several commercials and music videos including a Coca-Cola Super Bowl commercial in 2011. The duo split in 2012 to follow a solo career. His second short and first live action film, _The Elaborate End of Robert Ebb_, co directed with Clement Bolla and Matthieu Landour, won the Canal + award at Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival in 2012 [3] and was subsequently purchased by the network.[4] He directed many commercials since then, a short live action film Chiante (Pest) broadcast by Channel4 [5] and a feature documentary for France 3 about Prince Philip : _Le Mari de la Reine, l’inconnu de Buckingham_ [6] and also published a few books as an illustrator.

In June 2016 he released _To Build a Fire_, a cinematic adaptation in 2d animation of Jack London’s short novel. The film is touring festivals at the moment and won many awards including the Oscars qualifying Best Animation Grand Prize at the 2016 Rhode Island International Film Festival.[7]

In 2018 he creates alongside co-director Hélène Leroux the first ever Google Doodle in VR / 360 storytelling, a tribute to cinema pioneer Georges Méliès, in a film that encompassed his famous work such as _A Trip to the Moon_ and _The Impossible Voyage_[8]. The film has subsequently been nominated for an Emmy Awards in the 2018 Creative Arts Emmy Award category.[9]
