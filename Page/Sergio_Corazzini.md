SERGIO CORAZZINI (6 February 1886 – 17 June 1907) was an Italian poet, a member of the Crepuscolari movement.


Biography

Born in Rome into a wealthy family, Corazzini formed at the Collegio Umberto I, where he was passionate author and director of the college's puppet theater. Because of his family's economic difficulties due to his father's reckless speculations on the stock market and to his mother's disease, he was forced to leave the college and to work in an insurance company.[1]

Corazzini's poetical activities officially began in 1902, when his verses started to be regularly published in the magazine _Pasquino de Roma_ (later _Marforio_). His first poetic collection, _Dolcezze_, was released in 1904, and was shortly later followed by _L'amaro calice_, which got critical acclaim and critical comparisons to Stéphane Mallarmé, Francis Jammes and Jules Laforgue, among others. In 1905 Corazzini founded the short-lived literary magazine _Cronache latine_, wrote his only drama play _Il traguardo_, and released a third poetry collection, _Le aureole_.[2]

Seriously ill with tuberculosis, in 1906 he moved to Nocera Umbra, before being hospitalized at the Nettuno sanatorium in autumn of the same year. In sanatorium he started an unfinished translation of Joséphin Péladan's _Sémiramis_ and kept composing poetries, partly collected in _Libro per la sera della domenica_. In 1907 he eventually returned in his home in Rome, where he died on 17 June 1907, aged 21 years old.[3]
