The SAND PRAIRIE-SCRUB OAK STATE NATURE PRESERVE, formerly called the _Mason County State Wildlife Refuge and Recreation Area_, is a natural area located in the U.S. state of Illinois. Containing 1,460 acres (591 ha), it is a dedicated state nature preserve. It is located in western Mason County. The nearest town is Kilbourne, Illinois and the nearest numbered highway is Illinois Route 97. It contains fragmentary examples of the ecosystem described in its name.[1]

The Sand Prairie-Scrub Oak Nature Preserve is described on its webpage as "a mixture of dry sand prairie, dry sand savanna and dry sand forest." Areas of savanna and forest are characterized by black oak and blackjack oak, with some mockernut. It represents among the northernmost natural range trees of black hickory. Prairie grasses such as little bluestem, and sand plant life such as eastern prickly pear cactus, can be found.[2]

Sand Prairie-Scrub Oak was dedicated as a State Nature Preserve in April 1970.[3]


Current status

In the 2010s, Sand Prairie-Scrub Oak is managed by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) as a state nature preserve. The preserve does not have on-site staff, and is managed as a disjunct area of Sand Ridge State Forest, a larger conservation area within the same county.[4]
