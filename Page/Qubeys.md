Brief History & Overview

QUBEYS قبيس, along with Abdalle, are a subclan of the Surre (clan). Surre Mehe is a member of he Royal Dir tribe.

The Word QUBEYS is an ancient Somali word which was once common amongst the traditional Somali population. The word itself means cleanliness. With the introduction of Islam and the Arabic language to Somalia over 1000 years ago, Somalis changed the tradition of naming their sons Qubeys to Dahir or Tahir or طاهر in Arabic which also means cleanliness.

The QUBEYS AND ABDALLEH Surre Dir clans are known to have spread and taught the Islamic religion in southern and central Somalia. With the modern Somali society, it is believed that the Surre, both QUBEYS & ABDALLE have a large number of Faqīh (Islamic Jurists) and Islamic scholars.
