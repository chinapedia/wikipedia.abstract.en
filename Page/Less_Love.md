History

Less Love was formed in 2006 by band members Sky McCullough and Billy Gro in Oklahoma City.[3] The band has released two LPs and multiple singles on indie labels Lackpro Records and Quickstar Records. In 2008, the band was signed with Quickstar Records and released their first single, _Magical Purple Hair_. Their second single, _Lovelock_ was released in 2010.

The band released their first album in 2011. It was a multi-genre collection of original songs including upbeat noise rock, eerie ballads and a traditional country song called _Thank You Lord For Willie Nelson_. The latter included a pedal steel guitar solo played by Sub Pop Recording artist Bruce Tull of the Scud Mountain Boys. The album was titled _Go Fuck Yourself_.

Less Love collaborated with the band Wondernaut in 2013 to release their second album _Paradigms in the Design_. The album received positive reviews including being voted as _Album of the year_ by Rust Magazine.[4] Mark King, rhythm guitarist of Oklahoma-based band Hinder, said that if Fleetwood Mac and Sonic Youth had an ugly love child, it would sound a lot like the new album _Paradigms In The Design_.[5]

In 2016, Less Love recorded the single _Horse Race_ with Grammy Award winning music producer Michael Trepagnier (Coldplay) and engineer Kevin Lively (Rage Against The Machine). The single was nominated at _Independent Music Awards_and _Global Music Awards_. The music video was also voted _Best Music Video_ by _The Hollywood International Moving Picture Film Festival_ and won two awards at the _KSCR Music Video Awards_.[6] _Horse Race_ was originally written and recorded by the band Colourmusic. It was recorded after Sky McCullough and Colourmusic band member Nicholas Ley had a friendly disagreement. Nicholas said, nobody would ever cover Colourmusic, so Less Love did.

In addition to performing with Less Love McCullough is also an actor. He has worked in William H. Macy directorial debut _Rudderless_ and in Dinesh D'Souza's _America: Imagine the World Without Her_. He has also worked in Kings of Leon's music video _Beautiful War_.
