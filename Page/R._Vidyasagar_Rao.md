Advisor to Telangana government

Rao has been the main irrigation thinktank for Telangana State.[11] In the planning and redesigning of Kaleshwaram Project, Palamuru Rangareddy Project, Dindi Lift Irrigation Project, Devadula Project, Kanthanapalli project, Sitarama Project etc., in coordinating interstate agreements with Maharashtra, in formulation of rejuvenation and renovation of tanks, Mission Kakatiya, O&M guidelines for Lift Irrigation schemes etc. his contribution is enormous.

His initiation in abandoning Dummugudem- Nagarjunasagar Tail Pond project and leaving Ichamapalli project for long term perspective etc. had given right direction to the progress of irrigation in Telangana. He defended big lift irrigation schemes, namely Kaleshwaram and Palamuru Rangareddy projects, for Telangana State as they are inevitable due to geographical and climatic conditions of the state.Advisor's contributions in establishing a firm base for interstate aspects on water front for Telangana will remain remembered forever. In Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal issues or Supreme Court issues he was always the guiding force. He always worked with accommodation and audacity. Without antagonising the Central Government's view of interlinking of rivers, while representing Telangana State at meetings of National Water Development Agency, he advocated for revision of surplus waters available at Ichampalli, keeping the Tribunal Awards and changed technological advancements also in view. He presented that the surplus waters above 50% dependability can be diverted. In response, Ministry of Water Resources has constituted a committee to revise the guidelines to calculate the surplus river waters in the country.Getting the nod from Chief Minister KCR, Advisor Vidyasagar Rao attended the KRMB Meeting in October,2014. It was turning point in the functioning of KRMB. Explaining the relevant Clauses of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014 and supremacy of the Tribunal Award, Vidyasagar Rao could establish that KRMB did not have the powers to allocate the waters on its own. The then Chairman of KRMB accepted the substance of the arguments. Either Bachawat Tribunal Award or agreed quantities by both the States shall only be the basis for distribution of available waters by the Board, whether it is for Krishna Delta, or from NSP and Srisailam Reservoirs.

In June, 2015 to avoid any troubles in the coming year 2015-16, Mr Rao played a major role in arriving at an adhoc arrangement, for sharing of Krishna waters, in a temporary ratio of 299 : 512, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh respectively. He was also able to clarify the concept of ‘enbloc’ allocations of the Tribunal which paved way for utilisation of Krishna river waters anywhere in the basin as per requirement. Because of these arrangements, the water sharing for that year happened without any problems. And, in June, 2016, the same arrangement had been extended for this water year 2016-17 also.On the basis of Tribunal Awards, Vidyasagar Rao strongly advocated for rightful share to Telangana State in the waters diverted from Godavari to Krishna River. At Godavari River Management Board meetings also, acumen of Advisor Vidyasagar Rao could stall the Andhra Pradesh intentions of putting control of Major Projects on Godavari River within Telangana State, into the hands of Godavari River Management Board (GRMB).[12] At National Seminar on Minor Irrigation Projects 'Mission Kakatiya' organised by Kakatiya University, Telangana State, in November,2016, Rao was chief guest and addressed the participants and expalained about Government policies on Irrigation Projects.[13]
