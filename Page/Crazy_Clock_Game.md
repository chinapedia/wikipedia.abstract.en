The CRAZY CLOCK GAME, or simply just called _Crazy Clock_, is a 1964 board game published by Pavilion Games, a trademark of Toys "R" Us, and Ideal Toy Company. It was released a year after Mouse Trap.


Gameplay

From BoardGameGeek[1]: the game comes with a pack of cards, illustrated step-by-step, on how to build the board. Its track is a rube goldberg contraption. The deck of cards is then dealt out randomly to the players.
