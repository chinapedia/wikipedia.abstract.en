There were times when our players blasted Michigan players at full speed and only wound up flat on their backs with the other people on top of them. I've never seen such hitting."[46]

Post-season developments

On December 1, 1964, both the Associated Press (AP) and United Press International (UPI) released their final college football polls. Both the AP and UPI picked Alabama (which went on to lose to Texas in the 1965 Orange Bowl) at the No. 1 spot, Michigan at No. 4 and Ohio State at No. 9.[47][48] Two other Big Ten schools were ranked in the UPI's second ten, Illinois at No. 15 and Michigan State at No. 20.[49]

On December 22, 1964, Phil Dickens resigned as Indiana's head football coach and was given a new position as the university's general manager of off-campus physical facilities. In seven seasons, he compiled a 20-41-2 record with the Hoosiers. Due to over-zealous recruiting, he had been suspended for the 1957 season, and the team had been placed on probation from 1960 to 1963.[50]
