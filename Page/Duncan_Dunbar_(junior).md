DUNCAN DUNBAR (1803–1862) was a London-based shipowner who established what was described as the largest shipping line in Great Britain.[1]

Duncan was born on 9 September 1803 at 7 Fore Street, Limehouse, Middlesex. He died at his home at Porchester Terrace, Paddington on 6 March 1862.

Duncan left £1,500,000 in his will.

His father Duncan Dunbar senior had moved to London in the 1790s and founded a successful business as a brewer and wine merchant.[2] He settled in Limehouse, London in the 1790s, establishing his alcohol business at Dunbar wharf.[3] Duncan junior was 22 when his father died in 1825 and inherited the business with his brother John.[4]
