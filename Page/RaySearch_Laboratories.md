History

RaySearch was established in 2000 as a spin-off from Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm.[3] Founder and CEO Johan Löf started the company based on knowledge acquired during his PhD work on radiation treatment of moving tumors at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden.[4] A few months after its establishment, RaySearch entered into a partnership agreement with Philips Medical Systems, which resulted in the development of the P3 IMRT treatment planning system in 2001.[5]

In 2003, RaySearch was listed on the O-list of the Stockholm Stock Exchange,[6] which has been part of Nasdaq since 2008.[7] Between 2004 and 2007, RaySearch entered into partnership agreements with Nucletron,[8] IBA Dosimetry,[9] TomoTherapy[10] and Varian Medical Systems.[11] RaySearch algorithms were adopted for use in several of the leading radiation therapy treatment planning systems.

RaySearch also began engaging in clinical research collaborations, notably working with Princess Margaret Hospital,[12] Canada, and Massachusetts General Hospital,[13] US, to pioneer adaptive therapy and multi-criteria optimization.

In 2008, RaySearch made the decision to develop and market its own treatment planning system.[14] The RayStation system was launched in 2009, and West German Proton Therapy Center Essen placed the first order in the same year.[15]

RayStation received US FDA 510(k) clearance in 2010[16] and Massachusetts General Hospital subsequently placed the first US order for the system.[17] The first patient treatment with RayStation took place in 2011 at Massachusetts General Hospital.[18]

The first complete version of RayStation was released in 2012,[19] and RayStation was approved for sale in China in 2013.[20]
