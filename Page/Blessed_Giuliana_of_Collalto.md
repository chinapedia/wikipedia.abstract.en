Beata_Giuliana_di_Collalto_litography.png BLESSED GIULIANA OF COLLALTO (c. 1186, Collalto, Susegana - 1 September 1262, Venice) was an Italian Benedictine nun. She was beatified in 1743 by pope Benedict XIV.


Life

She was the daughter of Rambaldo VI di Collalto, count of Treviso, and his wife Giovanna, from the Mantuan house of the counts of Sant'Angelo. She was born in the family seat of the house of Collalto in the town of the same name.[1]

She became a nun at a young age and met Beatrice I d'Este in the Santa Margherita Convent on mount Salarola (Calaone). She moved to the convent on the Giudecca in Venice where she rebuilt the church of San Cataldo with its monastic annex and became its abbess. She died in 1262 and was buried in the church's cemetery, although her body was translated to its current resting place in the church of Sant'Eufemia, Venice in 1822.
