NV (pronounced as envy) is a 26-story residential high-rise in the Pearl District in Portland, Oregon. Formerly known as THE OVERTON, the tower opened in 2016.[1]


History

Plans for a 26-story apartment building at the site, to be called The Overton, were announced in November 2012.[2] The city approved the design in April 2014.[3] Demolition of a warehouse on the site began in July 2014.[4] Construction on the tower began in August 2014 by developer Unico Properties.[5][6] The construction process was complicated by the fact that the contractor was building two other residential towers adjacent to NV.[7] The residential high-rise opened in September 2016.[8]


Features

NV stands tall over 26 floors.[9] The first two floors contain retail space, with the rest of the tower consisting of 284 apartments.[10][11] It has 271 spaces of underground parking, and the structure uses a concrete shear wall design.[12] The project was developed by Seattle's Unico Properties and constructed by Andersen Construction, with the design by ZGF Architects.[13] A large terrace sits on top of the retail portion of the structure, with the residential tower occupying the rest of platform.[14] The tower is rotated by 45-degrees in order to allow residents enhanced views.[15]
