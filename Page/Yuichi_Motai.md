Research

Motai’s papers address fundamental and applied problems of sensory intelligence, which relate to specific application domains such as medical imaging, pattern recognition, computer vision, sensory-based robotic and biomedical applications. The majority of his 39 papers were published in _IEEE Transactions_, in 1) sensory Intelligence, focused on 2) adaptive prediction and 3) online classification methodologies:[6]

-   Sensory Intelligence: Fundamentals of robotic vision and data-intensive computing.
-   Adaptive Prediction: Kalman filter bank, Optimized prediction, Time sequences signals.
-   Online Classification: Kernel feature analysis, Neural networks, Deep learning.
-   Radiation Oncology: Medical imaging, 4D Cone beam computed tomography, 4D MRI.
-   Radiology: Computer-Aided Diagnosis, Distributed Database Network, Virtual colonoscopy.

Specific applications such as Radiation Oncology and Radiology were chosen based on his collaborator’s expertise.[7]


Teaching

Motai has offered more than 10 different courses. The 4 fields he teaches in are Pattern Recognition, Automatic Control, Dynamic and Multivariable Systems, Signals and Systems I [8]

Motai also taught at the University of Vermont, offering classes in the fields of Sensory-based robotics, Computer vision, and Ubiquitous computing.
