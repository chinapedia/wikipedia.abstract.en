Person

He is currently involved in the international project of the complete works of Marx and Engels (_Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe_) and working especially on Volume IV/27, which contains a significant amount of the late Marx’s notebooks on non-Western and precapitalist societies.

He has also written widely on Marxist theory, Foucault, the Frankfurt School, and contemporary developments in the U.S. and Europe. Anderson obtained American Council of Learned Societies Fellowship [2] and International Erich Fromm Prize[3] in 1996 and 2000 respectively, and National Endowment for the Humanities Collaborative Research Grant in 2001.[4]

His _Erich Fromm and Critical Criminology_ (coedited with Richard Quinney) won the International Erich Fromm Prize from the International Erich Fromm Society in Tübingen, Germany in 2000. More recently, his book _Marx at the Margins_ won Paul Sweezy Book Award from the Marxist Section of the American Sociological Association in 2011.[5] In addition, his _Foucault and the Iranian Revolution_ co-authored with Janet Afary was awarded with the Latifeh Yarshater Award for the Best Book in Iranian Women’s Studies in 2006.[6]
