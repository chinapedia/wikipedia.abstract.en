Critical reception

Sandra Sperounes of the _Edmonton Journal_ described the album as "a thrusting, sweaty, and intimate look at lust, loneliness, obsession, and privacy in a world dominated by cellphones, computers, and consumption."[3] Matt Williams commented in _Now_ that "July Talk's sophomore record bristles with the electricity of connection - between singers Leah Fay and Peter Dreimanis and the characters inside the songs."[4]
