ALEXANDER ORBI LEE ORBISON (born May 25, 1975), also known as ORBI, is an American drummer, writer, director, and film producer. Alex is president of Still Working Music Group, a publishing company and president and co-founder of Roy's Boys LLC, through which Roy Orbison's legacy is managed alongside his brothers, Roy Jr., and Wesley Orbison.[1]


Biography

Orbi is the youngest son of legendary rock and roll songwriter Roy Orbison and Barbara Orbison, born on May 25, 1975. He is their second born child, following Roy Kelton Orbison, Jr, born October 18, 1970. He has an older half-brother, Wesley Orbison. They lived on Old Hickory Lake, next door to his god-parents Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash in Hendersonville, Tennessee.[2] Growing up in a musical household, Orbi's first instrument was violin, as his hands were too small for the guitar,[3] followed by guitar and piano before landing on drums.[4] After Roy travelled to California to co-write with Jerry Lynn Williams and Will Jennings, Roy decided to move his family to Malibu, California in 1985.[5]

Malibu provided much needed support to Orbi when his father died in 1988. Roy was 52 years old, Alex was only 13.

Following the death of his mother in 2011, Alex moved back to Nashville, Tennessee after promising her he'd "get down to Nashville and take care of business" following her battle with pancreatic cancer,.[6] where he currently lives with his wife, Erika Wolf Orbison, and two dogs.[7]


Early musical career

In early 1990's, Orbi made friends with Jerry Lynn Williams' son Chris Williams, co-founding a band called Backbone69. Guitarist-vocalist Williams and drummer Orbi, Backbone69 included guitarist Duane Betts, son of the Allman Brothers' Dickey Betts, and bass player Berry Oakley Jr., son of Allman Brothers bassist Berry Oakley.[8]

In 1992, Orbi took his first professional position in publishing with Don Williams Music Group, but as Backbone gained popularity amongst the community, Orbi left his position in publishing to tour with Backbone69.[9]

Tragically, in 2001, Chris Williams was in a fatal car accident, which led to the dissipation of the band. As Betts described it, "It was like the tribe lost its chief."[10]

While Williams was alive, the members of Backbone frequently played as backing band for the son of Lou Adler, Cisco Adler's project called Whitestarr. After Williams' passing, Cisco invited the boys of Backbone to formally join the band.

After signing with Atlantic Records in 2000 and a television series on VH1, Whitestarr disbanded in 2008.
