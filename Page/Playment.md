PLAYMENT is an fully managed Human Intelligence platform which helps businesses offload large scale data operations to managed workforce. It breaks down large problems into micro-tasks and distributes among its large community of players(users). It works on the principle of Microwork, where a series of small tasks which together comprise a large unified project, and are completed by many people over the Internet.[1][2]

Players(users) can browse through existing tasks and complete them in exchange for points, the points can be further exchanged for vouchers on online e-commerce sites such as Flipkart, Amazon(India) and Paytm.
