ALFRED HARRIS (1868–1913), is a fictional character of the British television series, _Upstairs, Downstairs_. He was portrayed by George Innes.


Plot

Alfred Harris is the original footman at Eaton Place from 1895. He flees from the house in disgrace in 1905 after being caught by Rose in a sexual situation having sexual relations with an upstairs guest, Baron Klaus von Rimmer, a German who turns out to be a homosexual, before the police arrive to arrest him. Harris became the valet to Baron Klaus von Rimmer.

Alfred Harris returns to the house Eaton Place in 1913 seeking refuge after murdering his new employer and (it is implied) lover. Rose, the head houseparlourmaid, is shocked when Alfred, the Bellamys' former footman, turns up at Eaton Place one night. He claims he's been sacked by his former employer and is homeless. She agrees to hide him in one of the basement rooms, but is horrified when it later transpires Alfred is actually on the run from the police having murdered his previous employer. Hudson tells Mr Bellamy who notifies the police. A dramatic standoff results, with Alfred holding Edward hostage at knifepoint and taking Edward hostage in the coal cellar. Alfred is arrested and subsequently hanged for murder although Rose protests against the sentence arguing it was not right to do so to a person 'who's not right in the head.'[1][2]


Controversy

The episode was very controversial. The actors Baron Klaus von Rimmer (Horst Janson) and Alfred Harris (George Innes) had events in the episode, which never got to the stage:_″The episode was considered too controversial for American TV (at any time of the day or night), even though in Britain it got an afternoon repeat in 1973. Nevertheless, events in the episode never got to the stage shown in the lower photo, which is presumably the actors messing around!″_ [3]
