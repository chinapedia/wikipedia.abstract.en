The PHILIPPINE SCHOOL SULTANATE OF OMAN (also known as PHILIPPINE SCHOOL MUSCAT), established in 1989, is a private school in the Persian Gulf region.[1] Located in the city of Muscat, Oman, the school caters to the Filipino community as well as foreigners who live in Muscat, Oman.


History

Beginnings and opening (1989-1992)

In 1989, Filipino Overseas Workers conceived the school through the auspices and support of the Philippine Honorary Consul General his Excellency Essa bin Mohammed Al Zedjali in cooperation with the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).[2]

The district of Al-Wattayah became the first site of the school, then named as "Philippine Community School", where it was inaugurated on 2 February 1990.[3]

The school formally opened February 17, 1990.[4] 38 students were under multi-level classes of multi-grade in pre-elementary and elementary levels handled by volunteer teachers Mrs. Vernie Cate and Ms. Fatma Nasser al-Kitani.[5] June of the same year saw the arrival of the hired principal, Ms. Elenita Fernandez. Before the end of 1990, the first batch of elementary school teachers namely Ms. Isabelita E. Malong, Ms. Carmelita B. De Jesus, and Ms. Fe Edithaldine T. Vendiola, came from the Philippines. That period saw the school offering the Pre-Elementary Level (Nursery, Kindergarten, and Preparatory) and Elementary Level (Grades 1 – 6).

The first batch of graduates was the preparatory pupils handled by the school principal. September 1991 saw the arrival of the school's first preschool teacher, the late Mrs. Rosario G. Ballesteros. The School was recognized as a learning institution by the Ministry of Education and Youth, Sultanate of Oman on October 16, 1991.[6] School year 1990-1991 produced the first set of Grade Six graduates.[7]

Moving the school (1992-1999)

The school transferred to a new and bigger site in Al Khuwair during its third year of operation, school year 1992-1993.[8] It opened its secondary level with six first-year high school enrollees.[9] The first batch of High School teachers, Dr. Dionisio Viloria, Mrs. Erlinda M. Valientes, Ms. Anette Imperial and Mr. Enrique B. Pontillas, arrived for that year along with an elementary school teacher.[10] Dr. Dionisio Viloria served as principal for those terms.

Towards the end of the same school year, the graduating grade six pupils composed their graduation song under the tutelage of Miss Fe Edithaldine T. Vendiola. The graduation song, named as Hail PS, Hail, officially became the school's alma mater hymn later in 1994.1 [11]

As the residential area in Al-Khuwair was deemed unsafe for the students, the school transferred to another location in Ruwi,[12] not only for that safety reason but also to accommodate the growing population. Four additional teachers were hired for the school year 1993–1994.[13]

Having maintained the prescribed standards of instruction and having complied with the rules and regulations set by DECS, and in consonance with the policies for international schools by Ministry of Education in Oman, PCS gained its Government Recognition (No. 02, s. 1995) on 31 January 1995 under its new name, Philippine School.[14] This recognition permitted the school not only to offer pre-elementary and elementary, but also secondary courses.[15] Since then, the school has been operating in accordance with the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, particularly along organization, administration, and supervision for a private educational institution; likewise, with the Ministerial Decree No. 4/2006 of the Sultanate of Oman.[16]

At the end of the school year 1994–1995, nineteen (19) elementary pupils and the first batch of six (6) high school students graduated.[17]

Prior to the school year 1995-1996, the Parent-Teacher Association requested a site located in the center of the city. With their request granted, a better building at Madinat Qaboos became the next home of the school for that school year.[18] New teachers joined the teaching force. April 21, 1996 saw the Pledge of Loyalty, written by Miss Fe Edithaldine T. Vendiola, being recited for the first time.[19]

Four additional teachers were hired in the school year 1996-1997 in response to the need of the school with the continuous increase in student population.[20]

Return to Al-Khuwair (1999–2007)

The school permanently settled in the district of Al Khuwair during school year 1999–2000 with twenty three teachers and personnel.[21] An annex compound opened at the start of 2000.[22]

The academic year 2001–2002 saw the school being relocated to a bigger and more presentable villa at Al Khuwair 33.[23] At first, the primary division of the elementary department moved to the villa wherein the main school campus remained in its 1998–2001 villa. Later on August 2001, the intermediate level of elementary department and the high school department moved to a villa two doors from the annex compound.

This move served as a convenience to the school as the main and the annex occupy two separate villas in the same site; the Pre-elementary and Elementary Department in one villa and High school at the other villa. The Al Khuwair 33 site became home to Philippine School from 2001 to 2007.[24]

For the 2001–07 site, the elementary campus initially housed the kindergarten and preparatory levels of preschool, as well as Grades 1–3 from 2001–2004, before the intermediate levels (Grades 4–6) of the elementary level moved in. The canteen was located in a small single-room duplex within the compound and the campus contained a playground within the back area. The compound also housed the main performance stage which was erected in 2002 beside the duplex that housed the canteen as well as a mini-basketball court. The villa also housed the accounting office and finance services as well as principal's office. The faculty room was located on the second floor from 2001 to 2005 and was relocated to the rooftop level at third floor in 2006–2007.

The high school campus housed the intermediate levels (Grades 4-6) of elementary and the high school department from 2001–2004 before the intermediate levels were moved to the annex campus from 2004–2007. It had a small basketball court, a balcony used as a stage, a small canteen at an alleyway within the compound, and a resting lodge for service assistants at the back of the school. The school building housed a computer laboratory, high school classrooms, science laboratory, a high school faculty room, a technology and livelihood education room, and the guidance office. The building also housed the preparatory level from the school year 2006–2007

Relocation to the current site (2007)

In April 2005, the Board of Directors 2004–2006 initiated the acquisition of the new site at Al Khuwair Heights,[25] which is a lot near two neighboring schools, Egyptian School Muscat and American British Academy. The following year, a ground breaking ceremony took place and the construction of the new building started immediately.[26]

The transfer of the new school to the new site was facilitated by the 2006–2008 Board of Directors.[27] The new school building was inaugurated on the 16th of June 2007 by His Excellency Acmad D. Omar, Philippine Ambassador to the Sultanate of Oman.[28]

The academic year 2007–2008 saw the opening of classes in June. The 1990–2006 openings of the school year (with a summer vacation break after the first quarter) was changed. The 2007–2008 opening on June 15 was moved instead to June 23 due to the disastrous Cyclone Gonu affecting Oman and its neighboring countries on June 6, 2007, prompting a cleanup.

In 2008, the school's covered court was constructed.

For the school's 20th anniversary, a row of four bleachers was built on a portion of the slopes fronting the covered court. The 20th anniversary celebration proved to be the most pompous for the school.

March 3, 2010 saw the retirement of Mrs. Rosario G. Ballesteros. She passed away peacefully on August 12 of the same year, causing so much grief for the entire school.

K-12 era and change of school opening

After the graduation of the academic year 2011–2012, words of additional two years of high school, known as senior high school, surfaced on Philippine News. Later on the school year 2012–2013, the school began a test run of the K-12 curriculum, replacing first-year high school to Grade 7, and ending the 1945–2011 curriculum. On July of the same year the Fifteenth Congress, Third Regular Session, was held. This session dealt with the K-12 curriculum.

The two parts of the Legislative body of the Philippine government, the Senate and House of Representatives passed Senate Bill No. 3286 and House Bill No. 6643 on January 30, 2013. 2010–2016 Philippine president Benigno Simeon Cojuanco Aquino III signed the bill into law on May 2013, which is known now as Republic Act No. 10533, titled as the "ENHANCED BASIC EDUCATION ACT OF 2013", to which Filipinos refer to as K-12 LAW. The K-12 system took full effect and shape at the start of the academic year 2016–2017.[29]

In 2015, a move was set by the Philippine Department of Education and Commission on Higher Education to move class openings from June to August. The move was made in order to align with the international academic calendar. It was optional for schools in the Philippines wherein some complied and others remained to open in June. Due to the change in the Philippine basic education curriculum from K-4th year to K-12, Philippine School decided to do the same.

The K-12 system took full shape at the start of 2016-2017.

The school's new annex building was constructed across the school's back entrance on the former site of the ABA football field (which has since been moved to a parcel of land close to the ABA campus). It was opened on April 2017 and currently houses the Senior High School department as well as the school newsletter's offices and the Yearbook club.

From its humble beginnings, Philippine evolved from a simple academic institution into a highly structured organization having more than 400 students,[30] and 31 faculty, staff and administration.[31][32]

Today, Philippine School continues to foster quality education; adopting educational trends and developments; and implementing the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (R.A. 10533) through the K to 12 curriculum which offers kindergarten and 12 years of basic education (6 years of elementary education, 4 years of junior high school and 2 years of senior high school).[33]


Faculty and Staff

The majority of the teachers of the institution hail from different parts of the Philippines. Although most of the faculty are Filipino, there is also a very low number of foreign teachers. Foreign teachers, who are mostly of Middle Eastern heritage, teach Arabic to foreign students in the school. All teachers at hold a bachelor's degree, while some have master's degree.

Non-teaching staff and non-academic personnel are mostly Filipino while a few are foreign.


Students

Philippine School promotes respect for and understands cultural diversity.

The majority of the student population in Philippine School Muscat is Filipino, with only a few having dual-nationality. There are also foreign students who are from different countries. Omani students who plan to study in this institution must hold a copy of a "Permit to Study in a Non-Omani School", issued by the Ministry of Education.

Student Government

The school's current student governing body is the SCOPS (Student Council of the Philippine School). Student-related activities, donations, either school-related or other concerns (e.g. donations for flood victims and other disasters occurring in the Philippines most especially), and other events are organized or co-organized by the SCOPS. Elections for positions in the SCOPS occur on the first quarter of each school year, usually involving two parties in the election, after the campaign of two parties.

For the officers, the majority who have served in the SCOPS were both Filipino and foreign. Although the SCOPS presidents had been mostly Filipino, the first non-Filipino SCOPS president was a Tanzanian-Omani named Allasam Mohammed Al-Hinai, who served as SCOPS president during the school year 2011–2012 until his graduation on March 29, 2012 with the batch of high school and grade school of that academic year.


Activities

Class days

In observance of Muslim workweek and weekend, the school holds classes from Saturdays to Wednesdays from 1990 until 2012. In early 2013, due to reforms in a number of Arab States of the Persian Gulf in the 2000s and 2010s, the Thursday-Friday weekend was redone as a Friday-Saturday weekend. This change provided for the Muslim offering of Friday prayers and afforded more work days to coincide with the working calendars of international financial markets.

Holidays observed

In the past, the teachers are given a day off on Teachers' Day, which varies every school year. While teachers take a break while remaining in school, the high school students are allowed to impersonate or take over the duties of faculty members and teach a few classes then later report to the respective subject teachers of the class itself at the end of each session.

During the years of the school's 1945–2011 curriculum as well as when the school openings on April in the years 1990–2006, the only Philippine holidays observes are Rizal Day and Philippine Independence Day, with regular classes being held on other Philippine National Holidays (except if they fall on weekends). The school remains closed on all Omani holidays as well as Muslim holidays except on days of Ramadan where the school holds shortened school hours, with 40-45 minutes of each subject. There was a short summer break on March which finishes on the second week of April and a summer vacation at the end of first quarter every year which starts on the last days of June and ends on August. When classes opened in June at the start of 2007, everything remains unchanged except that the summer holidays began in April and ended in June.

The school also observes a Christmas and New Year break. January 1 in Oman is also declared as a public holiday. This remains unchanged throughout each school year since the institution's inception.

Below is a table of the Omani and Islamic holidays the school observes. The school's observance of Omani holidays remains unchanged since its foundation, in compliance with the laws of the Sultanate.

  Date                  Holiday
  --------------------- ---------------------------------
  1 Muharram            Islamic New Year
  12 Rabi'-ul-Awwal     Prophet Muhammad's Birthday

  January 1             New Year's Day
  July 23               Renaissance Day
  November 18           National Day

When the school decided to have classes start in August at the start of 2016–2017, the holidays were retained. Summer break began on May at the end of the school year 2015–2016 and some other Philippine Holidays were observed. They include the Holy Week's sacred days like Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Black Saturday with a regular class day on Easter Sunday. The summer break was moved to June until End of July. Islamic holidays like Eid al-Fitr, Isra Wal Miraj, as well as Omani holidays like Omani Renaissance Day are part of the summer break.

Celebrations

The school's foundation day, known as PS Day, is celebrated on a grand scale with various programs such as dances or field demonstrations, musical numbers, and choirs etc., with the students participating in it whole-heartedly.

Although the school hosted achievement weeks in the past, the achievement weeks have recently broken down into months such as Math-Science month, English LitMus festival and more. The school also hosts the Nutrition month in the past but since the change of curriculum during the start of 2015-2016, it doesn't host it anymore.

The Intramurals are also hosted by the school and is divided into four colors; red, yellow, blue, and green. It is usually held on December but now it varies.
