The office was established by the UN General Assembly on 20 December 1993[2] in the wake of the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights.

The office is headed by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, who co-ordinates human rights activities throughout the UN System and acts as the secretariat of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. The current High Commissioner is Michelle Bachelet of Chile, who succeeded Zeid Raad Al Hussein of Jordan on 1 September 2018.[3]

In 2018–2019, the department had a budget of US $201.6 million (3.7% of the regular UN budget),[4] and approximately 1,300 employees based in Geneva and New York City.[5] It is an ex officio member of the Committee of the United Nations Development Group.[6]


Functions and organization

Mandate

The mandate of OHCHR derives from Articles 1, 13 and 55 of the Charter of the United Nations, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and General Assembly resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993, by which the Assembly established the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. In connection with the programme for reform of the United Nations (A/51/950, para. 79), the OHCHR and the Centre for Human Rights were consolidated into a single OHCHR on 15 September 1997.

The objectives of OHCHR are to:

1.  Promote universal enjoyment of all human rights by giving practical effect to the will and resolve of the world community as expressed by the United Nations
2.  Play the leading role on human rights issues and emphasizes the importance of human rights at the international and national levels
3.  Promote international cooperation for human rights
4.  Stimulate and coordinates action for human rights throughout the United Nations system
5.  Promote universal ratification and implementation of international standards
