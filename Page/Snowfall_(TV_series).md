Reception

Critical response

On Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has an approval rating of 61% based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 6.19/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "_Snowfall_ struggles to create a compelling drama from its separate storylines, despite Singleton's accurate recreation of 1983 Los Angeles and a strong lead performance from Damson Idris."[12] On Metacritic, the series has a score of 62 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[13] A 100% approval rating for the second season was reported by Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.0/10 based on 7 reviews.[14]

Alan Sepinwall of Uproxx gave a mixed review of the series, criticizing the show's cliched storytelling and pacing; the latter he observed, "oddly feels sluggish and rushed at the same time, lingering over certain tasks and story beats... but then oddly jumping over story points in a way that had me frequently checking to be sure I hadn't skipped an episode by mistake." He further emphasized: "_Snowfall_{{'}}s not a bad drama at this stage, just more generic than it should be, especially on a channel known for making old TV ideas feel brand-new."[15]

Matt Zoller Seitz of Vulture, however, gave a positive review to _Snowfall_, praising "the attention it pays to the sights, sounds and textures of people's lives in 1983 Los Angeles, and to fine details of characterization — in other words, the sort of stuff that would never get a dramatic series a green light unless drugs and violence were attached to it." He further stated: "rather than go for a vibe like _The Wire_ or Steven Soderbergh's _Traffic_, which explored the drug trade with a newspaperman's anthropological detachment, _Snowfall_ aims for a bouncier, more seductive vibe." Seitz also praised the "phenomenal" acting of Idris, Peris-Mencheta, Hudson, and Rios.[16]
