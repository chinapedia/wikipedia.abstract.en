BUDGIE is a desktop environment that uses GNOME technologies such as GTK+ (> 3.x) and is developed by the Solus project as well as by contributors from numerous communities such as Arch Linux, Manjaro Linux and Ubuntu Budgie. Budgie's design emphasizes simplicity and elegance.

Applications

Budgie desktop tightly integrates with the GNOME stack, employing underlying technologies to offer an alternative desktop experience. Budgie applications generally use GTK and header bars similar to GNOME applications. Budgie builds what is effectively a Favorites list automatically as the user works, moving categories and applications toward the top of menus when they are used.


History

Budgie was initially developed as the default desktop environment for the Evolve OS Linux distribution. After the name change of Evolve OS to Solus, development of Budgie accelerated.

Early versions of Budgie were slow and prone to crashes. Speed and reliability have improved with time.

Budgie v1 was released on February 18, 2014 and v10 on December 27, 2015. The versioning scheme since changed, with the current release being 10.5.
