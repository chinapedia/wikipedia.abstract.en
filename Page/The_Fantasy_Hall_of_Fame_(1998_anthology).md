_THE FANTASY HALL OF FAME_ is an anthology of fantasy short works edited by Robert Silverberg, cover-billed as "the definitive collection of the best modern fantasy" as "chosen by the members of the Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America." It was first published in trade paperback by HarperPrism in March 1998. A hardcover edition issued by the same publisher with the Science Fiction Book Club followed in August of the same year. It has been translated into Italian and Polish. This work should not be confused with the earlier anthology of the same title with different content (only four stories are common to the two books) edited by Silverberg together with Martin H. Greenberg for Arbor House in October 1983.[1]

The book collects thirty novellas, novelettes and short stories by various authors, together with an introduction by Silverberg.
