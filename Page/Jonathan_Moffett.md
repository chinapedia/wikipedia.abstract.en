JONATHAN PHILLIP MOFFETT (born November 17, 1954), who goes by the stage name SUGARFOOT due to his frequent use of advanced techniques on the foot pedals, is an American drummer, songwriter and producer from New Orleans, Louisiana.[1] Since 1979, he has collaborated with the Jackson family, particularly Michael Jackson, over the course of 30 years. Later, he worked with other notable artists and producers such as Madonna, George Michael, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Quincy Jones and many others.[2]


Early life

Moffett is the third son of a musical family of siblings. His two other brothers played the guitar and the bass guitar, while Jonathan's father encouraged him to drum. His influences are Zigaboo, Buddy Rich, Louis Bellson, Billy Cobham, James Brown, Stevie Wonder and other drummers, primarily from New Orleans.[3]

He initially wanted to play the bass guitar long before drums. He was always acutely aware of the bass guitar parts in songs and mimicked them on the bass drum.[4] Moffett was never musically trained and learned to play drums on his own by ear.[5] He was nicknamed "_Sugarfoot"_ for his quick, articulate, and pronounced bass drum work, which requires a lot of precision and stamina for a drummer. He plays 16th note, 32nd note, and 64th note figures energetically and fluidly within rhythms.[6] Moffett started off his drumming career by performing locally with prominent bands within the region and at nightclubs as a young boy.

He came up with his kung-fu inspired signature moves during a marathon practice session late one evening - the "one-handed cymbal catch" and his "backlash-whiplash"[7] cymbal crashes (single and/or double hand) where he places two cymbals behind him and crashes/chokes them without looking.[8] Sugarfoot.png


Career

The Jacksons

Initial audition

Moffett's professional career initially started with The Jacksons. In 1979, through serendipity, he came across The Jackson's musical director, James McField, who told him they were auditioning for a new drummer. Though the final auditions were that day, he extended it for him, knowing how eager he was to play for the group. According to an article by Robyn Flans in _Drummer Magazine_ in September 1984, Moffett said:

  _He [McField] called that night and the audition was set for the next day. I was familiar with their songs [The Jacksons] because I had grown up with their music, yet I didn't know everything about the music...After we finished a few songs, they pulled me aside and said they'd let me know something soon. That evening, I got the call and they said they wanted me to join the group. It was just a miracle._[9]

Touring with The Jacksons

His first major tour was the Destiny Tour (22.1.1979 – 13.1.1980) with The Jacksons.[10] After his first show with the group, Michael Jackson was in awe by Moffett's ability to keep up with his dancing, always accenting his dance moves, which gave his dancing more power and prominence.[11] He also used his "one-handed cymbal catch" frequently, in which Moffett explained to Zildjian:

  _With the Jacksons, I'll use it to accent certain moments before the vocal chorus. OR when Michael makes a move and stops real quick, I'll accent that with a catch. You've got to do it fast and drop back into the rhythm without breaking time._[12]

He proceeded to perform on the Triumph Tour (8.7.1981 – 26.9.1981) with The Jacksons in 1981, which _Rolling Stone_ later named as one of the best 25 tours of 1967 to 1987. Epic decided to have one of the shows from the tour recorded due to its immense popularity and success. Moffett also drummed around the United States and Canada for the record-breaking and famous Victory Tour (6.7.1984 – 9.12.1984), where he met Madonna backstage who asked him to drum for her upcoming The Virgin Tour (10.10.1985 – 11.6.1985).[13][14][15] The Jacksons' Victory Tour promoted Michael Jackson's albums _Off the Wall_ (1979) and _Thriller_ (1982) and was promoted by Don King. Moffett performed with Eddie Van Halen, who made a few special appearances on some of the shows playing "Beat It" on guitar. Prince complimented Moffett after many shows with The Jacksons (and did the same seeing him live with other artists). He'd nod his head, smile, and say, "That was bad, you're bad".^([5]) Sugarfoot_on_Drums.jpg When Moffett turned professional, he designed innovative futuristic drum kits for every tour to compliment the stage design. His work with The Jacksons and unique drumming style led him to become one of the most in-demand pop music drummers and perform on 23 world tours.[16]

Pepsi commercial

Moffett was with Michael and the Jackson brothers during the infamous Pepsi commercial shoot in 1984 during the Victory Tour when Michael suffered from second-degree burns from the blazing pyrotechnics. He noticed the flames on Michael's hair at one point during the shoot and dropped his drum sticks and ran to help him just as some crew members did the same.[17]

In the studio and _The Jacksons Live!_ album

He is credited for live drumming on _The Jacksons Live!_ (1981) album, which is RIAA-certified Gold.[18] The double-disc album contains recordings of songs performed throughout the Triumph Tour (8.7.1981 – 26.9.1981). He also later recorded on The Jacksons' albums _Victory_ (1984) and _2300 Jackson Street_ (1989).[19]

Madonna

First three Madonna tours

After their initial meet during The Jacksons Victory Tour (6.7.1984 – 9.12.1984), Moffett finally agreed to tour with Madonna on her debut tour, _The Virgin Tour_ (10.4.1985 – 11.6.1985) alongside _Victory Tour_ bandmate, Patrick Leonard (musical director/keyboardist). The tour took place only in the United States and Canada. He was featured on Madonna's 1985 "Dress You Up" music video which was basically concert footage of her singing the song from _The Virgin Tour_. With the success of the tour, which was also released as a video album, Madonna requested Moffett to tour with her on her second tour, Who's That Girl Tour (14.6.1987 – 6.9.1987). The tour took place on a global level and was a huge commercial success, superseding the previous tour, and he finally toured with her on her controversial yet groundbreaking Blond Ambition Tour (13.4.1990 – 5.8.1990), which received accolades for its intricate choreography and stage production.[20][21] The tour was followed by a 1991 motion picture film, _Madonna: Truth or Dare_, in which Moffett was featured in.

In the studio

Moffett also recorded on three Madonna albums with producer Patrick Leonard: _True Blue_ (1986), _Like a Prayer_ (1989), and _I'm Breathless_ (1990).[22] He recorded drums, percussion, and background vocals on all three albums.[23]

Live Aid in 1985

He performed with the pop star at _Live Aid_ in 1985 performing her hit songs including "Holiday", "Into the Groove", and "Love Makes the World Go Round" with guest stars Nile Rodgers, Tom Bailey and Alannah Currie, and The Thompson Twins.[24]

Elton John

Touring with John

Elton turned to Moffett for his comeback Reg Strikes Back Tour (9.9.1988 – 10.6.1989) with a total of 87 shows and which he utilized to fight bad press. Elton again hired Moffett for his Sleeping with the Past Tour (28.7.1989 – 20.5.1990) a total of 74 shows.

In the studio with John

Moffett drummed on Elton's _Sleeping with the Past_ (1989) album, which was Elton's best selling album in Denmark – where the album was recorded. It was more successful than the tour. The album was also Elton's first platinum album since 1983 with many hit singles. Moffett was also credited on _To Be Continued_ a four-disc box set, recorded on various locations between 1965–1991, that chronicled Elton's songs from his days with Bluesology to the present day; it included newly recorded songs. He was also credited for live drumming on Elton's _Duets_ (1993) album for the song "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me" which was recorded live with George Michael at Wembley Arena in 1991. He is also credited on _Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin_ (1991) and was additionally featured in the 1991 TV movie _Two Rooms: A Tribute to Elton John & Bernie Taupin_.[25]

George Michael

George Michael called Moffett to tour with him on his Cover to Cover tour (15.1.1991 – 31.10.1991) totaling 30 shows and which took place in the United Kingdom, Brazil, Japan, Canada and the United States. Moffett also performed with Michael at the Rock in Rio Music Festival, which is a recurring music festival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

"This Is It" rehearsals and film

Moffett was supposed to perform on Jackson's This Is It Tour (13.7.2009 – 6.3.2010), rehearsing for months, but it never happened as Jackson passed away before its launch.[30]

He was featured in _Michael Jackson's This Is It_ (2009) documentary motion picture film alongside many other concert films, shows, and documentaries. _This Is It's_ worldwide gross revenue was $261 million, making it the highest-grossing concert film of all time. There are snippets of him drumming throughout the documentary as well as discussing the concert series that never came to be and his history with Jackson.[31]

Friendship with Michael Jackson

Though Moffett was known as _"Sugarfoot"_ to the rest of the world, Michael cut his stage name short and called him _"Foot"_ instead. Moffett was Michael Jackson's live drummer of choice from the beginning when he first started drumming with The Jacksons. Michael always called him first for each tour and show, even when was under contract with other artists.[32] The two collaborated over the course of 30 years starting in 1979 to 2009 with a total of four tours together; _This Is It_ (13.7.2009 – 6.3.2010) would have been the fifth. Aside from working with Michael, he was friends with him and hung out at The Jackson Estate (Hayvenhurst home) with the family (including with Jackson family matriarch, Katherine Jackson, who he considers his "second mother") and one-on-one with Michael at Neverland Ranch and his other homes.[33] The two had drawing contests on the road when touring and Jackson sent him birthday and holiday cards when they were not together.[34] Moffett was with him the night before he died until 1 AM.[35] Jonathan_Moffett_Gold_Drum_Kit.jpg]]
