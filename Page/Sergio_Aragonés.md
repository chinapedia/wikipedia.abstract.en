SERGIO ARAGONÉS DOMENECH (; born September 6, 1937)[1] is a Spanish/Mexican cartoonist and writer best known for his contributions to _Mad_ magazine and creating the comic book _Groo the Wanderer_.

Among his peers and fans, Aragonés is widely regarded as "the world's fastest cartoonist".[2] _The Comics Journal_ has described Aragonés as "one of the most prolific and brilliant cartoonists of his generation".[3] _Mad_ editor Al Feldstein said, "He could have drawn the whole magazine if we'd let him."[4]


Early life

Born in Sant Mateu, Castellón, Spain, Aragonés emigrated with his family to France, due to the Spanish Civil War, before settling in Mexico at age 6. Aragonés had a passion for art since early childhood. As one anecdote goes, Aragonés was once left alone in a room by his parents with a box of crayons. His parents returned sometime later to find that he had covered the wall in hundreds upon hundreds of drawings. Aragonés recalled his early difficulties in Mexico, saying, "I didn't have too many friends because I had just arrived. You're the new kid, and you have an accent. I've always had an accent ... When the other kids make fun of you, you don't want to get out of the house. So you stay at home, and what do you do? You take pencils and start drawing."[5]

Aragonés used his drawing skill to assimilate. "The earliest money I ever made was with drawings", he remembered. "The teacher would give us homework, which would consist of copying Chapter Eleven, including the illustrations ... a beetle or a plant, the pistil of a flower, or soldiers – that type of thing. All the kids who couldn't draw would leave a square where the drawing was, and I would charge them to draw that. The equivalent of a few pennies ... That's probably why I draw so fast, because I drew so many of them."[6]

He made his first professional sale in 1954 when a high school classmate submitted his work to a magazine without telling Aragonés. He continued to sell gag cartoons to magazines while studying architecture at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where he learned pantomime under the direction of Alejandro Jodorowsky. "I joined the class", Aragonés recalled, "not to become a mime but to apply its physical aspects of movement to my comics." In 1962, Aragonés moved to the United States.

Art collector Jeff Singh spoke with Sergio at a convention and wrote. "A friend told me that Sergio's father was a film director/producer in Mexico. I asked about this and it is true. His father didn't want the family on set for fear of actors and workers befriending the family in order to win favor with the father. Among the projects worked on, his father did work for the Irish McCalla TV series _Sheena, Queen of the Jungle_ which was filmed in Mexico (in 1955). On one of the rare occasions Sergio was on set the stuntman didn't show up. Sergio had to put on the Sheena costume and did some stunts which I understand included swinging from a vine and diving into water. He was in his early teens at this time. He said they were pretty distant shots as despite the wig and costume he didn't look at all like Irish. Irish was not on set that day and he lamented never having got to meet her."


Arrival in the United States

According to the artist, he arrived in New York in 1962[7] with nothing but 20 dollars and his portfolio of drawings. After working odd jobs around the city, Aragonés went to _Mad_'s offices on Madison Avenue hoping to sell some of his cartoons. "I didn't think I had anything that belonged in _Mad,_" said Aragonés. "I didn't have any satire. I didn't have any articles. But everybody was telling me, 'Oh, you should go to _Mad_."[8]

Since his knowledge of English was not very extensive, he asked for the only _Mad_ artist he knew of that spoke Spanish, Cuban-born artist Antonio Prohías, creator of the comic strip "Spy vs. Spy". Aragonés hoped Prohías could serve as an interpreter between him and the _Mad_ editors. According to Aragonés, this proved to be a mistake, since Prohías knew even less English than him. Prohías did receive Aragonés very enthusiastically and, with difficulty, introduced the young artist to the _Mad_ editors as "Sergio, my brother from Mexico," temporarily leading to even further confusion, as the _Mad_ editors thought he was "Sergio Prohías."[9] _Mad_ editor Al Feldstein and publisher Bill Gaines liked what they saw, and Aragonés became a contributor to the magazine in 1963. His first sale was an assortment of astronaut cartoons which the editors arranged into a themed article.[10] With the publication of the 500th issue in 2009, Aragonés' work had appeared in 424 issues of _Mad_, second only to Al Jaffee (451 issues).[11] "They told me, 'Make _Mad_ your home,'" said Aragonés, "and I took it literally."


Marginals

The cartoonist has a featured section in every issue called "A _Mad_ Look At...", typically featuring 4–5 pages of speechless gag strips that are all related to a single subject, such as "Gambling," "UFOs" or "Pizza." Aragonés became famous for his wordless "drawn-out dramas" or "marginals" which were inserted into the margins and between panels of the magazine. The drawings are both horizontal and vertical, and occasionally extend around corners. Prior to Aragonés' arrival at _Mad_, the magazine had sometimes filled its margins with text jokes under the catch-all heading "Marginal Thinking." Aragonés convinced Feldstein to use his cartoons by creating a dummy sample issue with his Marginals drawn along the edges. The staff of _Mad_ enjoyed his marginals, but did not expect him to be able to maintain the steady stream of small cartoons needed for each issue.[12] Aragonés has provided marginals for every issue of _Mad_ since 1963 except one (his contributions to that issue were lost by the Post Office). Associate Editor Jerry DeFuccio said, "Writing the 'Marginal Thinking' marginals had always been a pain in the butt. Sergio made the pain go away."[13]

Aragonés is a very prolific artist; Al Jaffee once said, "Sergio has, quite literally, drawn more cartoons on napkins in restaurants than most cartoonists draw in their entire careers."[14] In 2002, writer Mark Evanier estimated that Aragonés had written and drawn more than 12,000 gag cartoons for _Mad_ alone.[15]


Comic books

In 1967, he began writing and illustrating full stories for various DC Comics titles, including _The Adventures of Jerry Lewis_, _Angel and the Ape_, _Inferior Five_, _Young Romance_, and for various horror anthologies.[16] He wrote or plotted stories that were illustrated by other artists. Aragonés helped create DC's Western series _Bat Lash_[17] and the humor title _Plop!_.[18] Aragonés broke with DC when the company began insisting on work-for-hire contracts; when Aragonés balked, an editor tore up Aragonés' paycheck in front of his face. He'd been trying obliquely to sell a comic book premise to DC or Marvel, but neither company would allow Aragonés to retain the copyright. "I didn't want anyone stealing the idea", said Aragonés, "and they weren't able to talk on a theoretical basis."

Aragonés had created the humorous barbarian comic book _Groo the Wanderer_ with Mark Evanier in the late 1970s, but the character did not appear in print until 1982. Groo was so named because Aragonés sought a name which meant nothing in any language. Evanier's role originally was as something of a translator, as Aragonés was still somewhat shaky at expressing his ideas in English. Eventually the two began collaborating on story ideas, and there have been several Groo stories in which Evanier is credited as the sole writer. Aragonés has since become fluent in English. The other regular contributors to the comic book are letterer Stan Sakai (himself the creator/artist of Usagi Yojimbo), and colorist Tom Luth. As a creator-owned series, _Groo_ has survived the bankruptcy of a number of publishers, a fact which led to the industry joke that publishing the series was a precursor to a publisher's demise. The title was initially published by Pacific Comics, briefly by Eclipse Comics, then Marvel Comics under their since-discontinued Epic Comics imprint[19] which allowed creators to retain copyrights, then Image Comics, and currently Dark Horse Comics.[20]

On December 2, 1982, Marty Feldman died from a heart attack in a hotel room in Mexico City. This occurred during the making of the film _Yellowbeard_. Aragonés, who was filming nearby and was dressed for his role as an armed policeman, had introduced himself to Feldman that night. He encountered Feldman abruptly, startling and frightening him, which may have induced Feldman's heart attack. Aragonés has recounted the story with the punchline "I killed Marty Feldman". The story was converted into a strip in Aragonés' issue of DC Comics' _Solo_.[21]

In the early 1980s, Aragonés collaborated with the Belgian cartoonist François Walthéry on _Natacha, l'hotesse de l'air_, a well known series from the magazine _Spirou_. This story was titled "Instantané pour Caltech". Aragonés appears in the strip as a police officer character ( / DUPUIS Editor – Belgium).

Television

In addition to printed work, Aragonés has worked in television animation. He worked on the NBC program _Speak Up America_ (1980) where he would draw during the show. His segments were used for many years on the Dick Clark _Bloopers_ programs. Frequent collaborator Mark Evanier related an anecdote from their time on the short-lived 1983 NBC series _The Half Hour Comedy Hour_, which featured a guest appearance by model Jayne Kennedy:

  This was one of the most beautiful women in the world, and she wore this dress that was very revealing. So much so, the censors wouldn't let us put her on the air in it without adding some material. So we're all talking to her, the writers and whoever, just in awe of this woman. And Sergio comes walking in looking like a homeless person, carrying his portfolio. And Jayne sees him and she shouts, 'Sergio!' and she runs over and starts kissing him passionately. They'd worked together before, it turned out. But Johnny Carson comes walking out into the hallway and he thinks Jayne Kennedy is being sexually assaulted by a homeless person in the NBC hallways. He came over to make sure she was okay. She said it was fine, that she knew him, and I said, 'It's okay, he's a cartoonist.' So Johnny gives that classic look and he says, 'I knew I should have taken up drawing.'[24]

In 2009, Aragonés told an interviewer, "I'm thinking and laughing all day long. Every time I think of a joke, I'm also telling myself a new joke. It's a great way to live."[25]
