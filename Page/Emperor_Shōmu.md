was the 45th emperor of Japan,[1] according to the traditional order of succession.[2]

Shōmu's reign spanned the years 724 through 749.[3]


Traditional narrative

Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (_imina_)[4] is not clearly known, but he was known as Oshi-hiraki Toyosakura-hiko-no-mikoto.[5]

Shōmu was the son of Emperor Monmu and Fujiwara no Miyako, a daughter of Fujiwara no Fuhito.[6]

Shōmu had four Empresses and six Imperial sons and daughters.[7]

Events of Shōmu's reign

Shōmu was still a child at the time of his father's death; thus, Empresses Gemmei and Gensho occupied the throne before he acceded.[8]

-   724 (_Yōrō 8, 1st month_): In the 9th year of Genshō_-tennō_ 's reign (元正天皇九年), the empress abdicated; and her younger brother received the succession (‘‘senso’’). Shortly thereafter, Emperor Shōmu is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).[9]
-   JANUARY 31, 724 (_Jinki 1_) : The era name is changed to mark the accession of Emperor Shōmu.[10]
-   735–737: A major smallpox epidemic raged throughout Japan, incurring adult mortality rates of about 25% to 35%.[11]

Shōmu continued to reside in the Hezei Palace.[12]

Shōmu is known as the first emperor whose consort was not born into the imperial household. His consort Kōmyō was a non-royal Fujiwara commoner. A ritsuryō office was created for the queen-consort, the _Kogogushiki_; and this bureaucratic innovation continued into the Heian period.[13]

Emperor Shōmu's tour to the eastern provinces

While battle maneuvers of the Fujiwara no Hirotsugu Rebellion were still underway, in Tenpyō 12 10th month (November, 740) Emperor Shōmu left the capital at Heijō-kyō (Nara) and traveled eastward via Horikoshi[14] (堀越頓宮; today Tsuge; 10th month, 29th day: November 22), Nabari (10th month, 30th day: November 23), Ao[15] (安保頓宮; today Aoyama ; 11th month 1st day: November 24) to Kawaguchi in Ichishi District, Ise Province (today part of Tsu, formerly part of Hakusan) where he retreated together with his court to a temporary palace. One of his generals was left in command of the capital.[16] Presumably Shōmu feared Fujiwara supporters in Nara and was hoping to quell potential uprisings in other parts of the country with his presence.[17][18][19][20] After four days travelling through heavy rain and thick mud, the party reached Kawaguchi on Tenpyō 12 11th month, 2nd day (25 November, 740) A couple of days later, they learn of Hirotsugu's execution and that the rebellion had been quelled.[21]

Despite the good news, Shōmu did not return to Heijō-kyō immediately, but stayed in Kawaguchi until Tenpyō 12 11th month, 11th day (4 December, 740). He continued his journey east, then north via Mino Province and back west along the shores of Lake Biwa to Kuni in Yamashiro Province (today in Kizugawa) which he reached on Tenpyō 12 12th month, 15th day (6 January, 741). Places passed along the way included Akasaka[22] (赤坂頓宮; today Suzuka; 11th m. 14th d.: Dec 7）, Asake district (朝明郡; today Yokkaichi; 11th m. 20th d.: Dec 13）, Ishiura[23] (石占頓宮; today Tado; 11th m. 25th d.: Dec 18）, Tagi district (当伎郡; today Yōrō; 11th m. 26th d.: Dec 19）, Fuwa[24] (不破頓宮; today Tarui; 12th m. 1st d.: Dec 23）, Yokokawa[25] (横川頓宮; today Santō or Maihara; 12th m. 6th d.: Dec 28), Inukami[26] (犬上頓宮; today Hikone; 12th m. 7th d.: Dec 29）, Gamō district (蒲生郡; today near Yōkaichi; 12th m. 9th d.: Dec 31）, Yasu[27] (野洲頓宮; today Yasu or Moriyama; 12th m. 10th d.: Jan 1）, Awazu[28] (禾津頓宮; today Ōtsu; 12th m. 11th d.： Jan 2）, Tamanoi[29] (玉井頓宮; today Yamashina-ku, Kyoto; 12th m. 14th d.）.[30] Situated among the hills and near a river north of Nara, Kuni was easily defensible. In addition, the area was linked with the Minister of the Right, Tachibana no Moroe, while Nara was a center of the Fujiwara clan.[31] On Tenpyō 12 12th month, 15 day (6 January, 741) Shōmu proclaimed a new capital at Kuni-kyō.[32][33][34]

Legacy

Shōmu, a devout Buddhist, is best remembered for commissioning, in 743, the sixteen-meter high statue of the Vairocana Buddha (the _Daibutsu_) in Tōdai-ji of Nara. At the time, this was such a massive undertaking that later chroniclers accuse him of having completely exhausted the country's reserves of bronze and precious metals.[49] In 752, the Shōmu held the Eye-opening Ceremony of the Great Buddha.

Earlier in 741, he established the system of provincial temples, making this the closest anyone ever came to declaring Japan a Buddhist nation. In addition he commissioned the observance of the ohigan holiday for both spring and autumnal equinox.[50]

Emperor Shōmu died at age 56.[51]

Burialmound_EmperorShomu_Nara.jpg The actual site of Shōmu's grave is known.[52] This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (_misasagi_) at Nara.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Shōmu's mausoleum. It is formally named _Sahoyama no minami no misasagi_.[53] The tomb site can be visited today in Horenji-cho, Tenri City near Nara City.[54] The Imperial tomb of Shōmu's consort, Empress Kōmyō, is located nearby.[55]

Kugyō

is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career. During Shōmu's reign, this apex of the _Daijō-kan_ included:

-   _Daijō-daijin_ (720–735), Toneri_-shinnō_ (舎人親王) (9th son of Emperor Tenmu).[56]
-   _Daijō-daijin_ (737–745), Suzuka_-ō_ (鈴鹿王) (son of Prince Takechi).[57]
-   _Sadaijin_ (724–729), Nagaya_-ō_ (長屋王) (son of Prince Takechi).[58]
-   _Sadaijin_ (743–756), Tachibana no Moroe (橘諸兄) (formerly Katsuragi_-ō_, Prince Katsuragi) (half brother of Empress Kōmyō) .[59]
-   _Udaijin_ (734–737), Fujiwara no Muchimaro (藤原武智麻呂) (son of Fujiwara no Fuhito).[60]
-   _Naidaijin_, Fujiwara no Toyonari (藤原豊成) (son of Fujiwara no Muchimaro).[61]
-   _Dainagon_, Fujiwara no Fusasaki (藤原房前) (son of Fujiwara no Fuhito).[62]
