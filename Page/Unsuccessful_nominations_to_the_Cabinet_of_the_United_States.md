Roger_B._Taney_-_Brady-Handy.jpg was the first nominee to a Cabinet position to be rejected.]] Members of the Cabinet of the United States are nominated by the president and are then confirmed or rejected by the Senate. Listed below are unsuccessful cabinet nominees—that is, individuals who were nominated and who either declined their own nomination, failed the confirmation vote in the Senate, or whose nomination was withdrawn by the president.

To date, nine nominations to the cabinet have been rejected by the Senate. In addition, 15 nominations have been withdrawn, either by the president or by the nominee. President John Tyler holds the record for most cabinet nominees rejected by the Senate; four of his nominees failed to win confirmation.[1]


Rejected by the Senate

Andrew Jackson

Roger B. Taney

In 1833, President Andrew Jackson used a recess appointment to name Roger B. Taney, who was serving as United States Attorney General, as the United States Secretary of the Treasury. Jackson wanted Taney to help him dismantle the Second Bank of the United States. He helped Jackson draft a statement on the veto of the bank's renewal, and agreed to withdraw money from the bank.[2] In an ensuing fight, the Senate rejected Taney by a vote of 28–18 in 1834.[3]

John Tyler

Caleb Cushing

Caleb_Cushing_by_Mathew_B_Brady.jpeg's Cabinet nomination was rejected three times in one day.]] President John Tyler nominated Caleb Cushing for Secretary of the Treasury. Tyler had a contentious relationship with the Senate over his vetos of legislation, and the Senate refused to confirm Cushing for this office on March 3, 1843. Tyler renominated Cushing twice more that day, and both times the Senate rejected his nomination.[4][5]

David Henshaw

David Henshaw became Secretary of the Navy in July 1843, following a recess appointment by Tyler. He was formally nominated in December 1843, and his nomination was rejected by a vote of 34–8 on January 15, 1844,[6][7] after Navy officers, including Admiral David Farragut, objected to Henshaw's plans to combat sectional divisions within the Navy by assigning Northerners to Southern naval posts and Southerners to Northern naval posts.[8]

James S. Green

Tyler nominated James S. Green for Secretary of the Treasury in 1844. The nomination was rejected on June 15, 1844.[9][10]

James Madison Porter

Tyler nominated James Madison Porter to be Secretary of War in 1844. The Senate rejected this nomination on June 30, 1844, by a vote of 38–3.[11][12]

Andrew Johnson

Henry Stanbery

Henry Stanbery served as Attorney General for President Andrew Johnson. Stanbery resigned in 1868 to defend Johnson during his impeachment trial. After Johnson was acquitted, he nominated Stanbery to resume his tenure as Attorney General, but the Senate rejected the nomination, 29–11.[13][14][15]

Calvin Coolidge

Charles B. Warren

President Calvin Coolidge nominated Charles B. Warren, a Michigan attorney, as Attorney General. The nomination was rejected on March 10, 1925, by a vote of 41–39.[16][17] The lengthy and contentious debate on Warren's nomination consumed the first few days of the new Congress, as "Democrats and insurgent Republicans united to oppose the confirmation on the ground" that Warren's close association with the Sugar Trust made him unsuitable to enforce federal antitrust laws.[18] The nomination originally stood at a 40–40 deadlock, but Vice President Charles Gates Dawes did not arrive in the Senate chamber in time to use his casting vote before Senator Lee S. Overman of North Carolina switched his vote.[19] Coolidge resubmitted the nomination to the Senate, but Warren was again rejected on March 16, by a vote of 46–39.[20][21][22]

Dwight Eisenhower

Lewis Strauss

In 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower nominated Lewis Strauss as Secretary of Commerce in a recess appointment. Strauss had made enemies in the Senate during his tenure as Chair of the United States Atomic Energy Commission.[23] Strauss lost the confirmation vote, 49–46.[24][25][26] In July 1959, Strauss resigned.[27]

George H. W. Bush

John Tower

In 1989 President George H. W. Bush nominated John Tower, a former United States Senator, to be Secretary of Defense. He was investigated over claims of drunkenness, womanizing, and ties with defense contractors.[28] The Senate rejected Tower by a vote of 53–47.[29][30]


Withdrawn nominations

John Adams

Lucius Horatio Stockton

In January 1801, during his lame-duck session, John Adams nominated Lucius Horatio Stockton to be Secretary of War. Stockton withdrew himself from consideration.[31][32]

James Madison

Henry Dearborn

President James Madison nominated Henry Dearborn as Secretary of War in 1815. He had previously held the same position from 1801 to 1809 under Thomas Jefferson. However, Dearborn had failed as a general in the War of 1812. The Senate rejected Dearborn's nomination, but allowed him to withdraw.[33]

Andrew Johnson

Thomas Ewing

ThomasEwingSr.jpg]] In 1868, President Andrew Johnson forced Edwin Stanton, a Radical Republican who had served as Secretary of War since 1862, to resign from his cabinet, in violation of the 1867 Tenure of Office Act. Johnson then nominated Thomas Ewing. The Senate refused to consider Ewing's nomination, while they moved to impeach Johnson.[34]

Bill Clinton

Zoë Baird

In 1993, President Bill Clinton nominated Zoë Baird to become his Attorney General. Before she could have a confirmation hearing, it became known that she had hired undocumented workers for her household, which became known as the "Nannygate" affair.[35] Baird paid a civil penalty levied by the Immigration and Naturalization Service,[36] and Clinton withdrew the nomination.[37]

Kimba Wood

Kimba Wood became Clinton's second choice for Attorney General. She also hired an undocumented worker, though she did so before it was made illegal by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. She withdrew from consideration.[38]

Bobby Ray Inman

Clinton selected Bobby Ray Inman to become his Secretary of Defense on December 16, 1993. Inman withdrew his nomination during a press conference on January 18, 1994, in which he accused William Safire, a columnist for _The New York Times_, of recruiting Senator Bob Dole to attack him, and claimed that Dole and Trent Lott intended to "turn up the heat" on his nomination.[39] Dole and Lott denied this.[40]

Anthony Lake

Clinton nominated Anthony Lake to become the Director of Central Intelligence in December 1996.[41] He withdrew in March 1997, after questioning by the United States Senate Intelligence Committee turned contentious.[42][43]

Hershel W. Gober

Clinton nominated Hershel W. Gober to become the United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs in 1997. When it became clear that the United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs intended to use the confirmation hearings "to explore circumstances surrounding the exoneration of Mr. Gober after he was accused of sexual misconduct in 1993," Clinton withdrew the nomination.[44]

George W. Bush

Linda Chavez

Linda_Chavez_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg]] In 2001, President George W. Bush nominated Linda Chavez for Secretary of Labor. She withdrew from consideration after it was revealed that she had given money to a one-time undocumented immigrant who lived in her home more than a decade earlier.[45][46] Chavez withdrew her nomination, but stated she never felt pressure from Bush's political team to do so.[47]

Bernard Kerik

On December 3, 2004, President Bush nominated Bernard Kerik to become United States Secretary of Homeland Security.[48] On December 10, Kerik withdrew from the nomination, after acknowledging that he had unknowingly hired an undocumented worker as a nanny and housekeeper.[49]

Barack Obama

Tom Daschle

While still President-elect of the United States, Barack Obama chose Tom Daschle to be his United States Secretary of Health and Human Services. He withdrew in February 2009 over $140,000 in unpaid taxes.[50]

Bill Richardson

On December 3, 2008, Obama chose Bill Richardson to be his Secretary of Commerce.[51] On January 4, 2009, Richardson withdrew his name from consideration because of a federal grand jury investigation into pay-to-play allegations.[52] Later that year, the investigation ended and Richardson and his staff members were cleared of any wrongdoing.

Judd Gregg

Following Richardson's withdrawal, Obama nominated Judd Gregg to be his Secretary of Commerce. On February 12, 2009, Gregg withdrew his name from consideration for the position, citing disagreements with Obama on issues surrounding the United States Census and the stimulus bill.[53]

Donald Trump

Andrew Puzder

On December 8, 2016, President-elect Donald Trump nominated Andrew Puzder as his Secretary of Labor. Puzder had difficulty divesting himself from his company, CKE Restaurants.[54] A workers group alleged that he had committed wage theft and sexual harassment against his employees,[55] and he admitted to have hired an undocumented worker as a nanny without paying taxes for her.[56] An Oprah Winfrey tape from 1990 featured his first wife describing spousal abuse that he allegedly committed.[57] In reaction to public coverage of the tape, his former wife said she had been "misled by faulty advice" during her divorce proceedings, and had subsequently "fully" withdrawn those allegations in 1990. She was adamant that Puzder was "not abusive or violent".[58]

On February 15, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell informed the Trump administration that Puzder did not have the votes required to be confirmed.[59] That day, Puzder withdrew himself from consideration.[60]

Ronny Jackson

President Trump fired David Shulkin as Secretary of Veterans Affairs on March 28, 2018, and nominated Ronny Jackson, serving as Physician to the President, to succeed him.[61] Senators expressed skepticism of the nomination due to Jackson's lack of management experience.[62]

Current and former employees on the White House Medical Unit accused Jackson of creating a hostile work environment, excessively drinking on the job, and improperly dispensing medication Amid these reports, the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs postponed Jackson's confirmation hearings on April 23.[63] Jackson withdrew his nomination on April 26.[64]
