_PRABANDHA-KOSHA_ (IAST: Prabandhako≈õa) is an Indian Sanskrit-language collection of _prabandha_s (legendary biographical narratives). It was compiled by the Jain scholar Rajashekhara Suri in 1349 CE. It describes the lives of 24 people, including 10 Jain scholars, 4 Sanskrit poets, 7 kings and 3 Jain householders. It is also known as _Chaturvinshati Prabandha_.

The content of the collection is based on the information that Rajashekhara obtained from his teacher Tilakasuri. He composed the work at Delhi, under the patronage of Madanasimha, whose father had been honoured by Shri Mahamad Shahi (probably Muhammad Tughluq).

Only the 7th _prabandha_ in the collection (the one about Mallavadi-Suri) is written completely in verse form; the rest of the _prabandha_s use colloquial Sanskrit prose.
