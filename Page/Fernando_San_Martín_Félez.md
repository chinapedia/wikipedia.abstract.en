Artistic trend

In 1958 he meets Fernando Arrabal, Roland Topor and Alejandro Joborowsky, founders of "Panic" Movement. Earlier this year, along with painters Evarist Vallès, Alberto Plaza, José CANES, Jean-Claude Fiaux, Jacques Albertini, the sculptor Alberto Guzman and writer Charles Juliet created the "Movement" group, for plastic affinities.

Develops the first pictures "panics" in 1964 with the realization of portraits of F. Arrabal, combining this year with abstraction and figuration. Until the end of it.

Having visited the retrospective exhibition of the painter Kandinsky at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, he decided to leave the abstraction permanently, given the extensive exploration that this artist made in all shapes and trends that later we met with various "isms".
