_Nativity!_ (2009)

Paul Maddens is a teacher who once had ambitions of being successful as an actor, producer or director. Every year St Bernadette's Primary School in Coventry, where he teaches, competes with a local private school (Oakmoor) to see who can produce the best nativity play. Paul hates Christmas because his ex girlfriend Jennifer Lore, who attended drama school with him, left him at Christmas before he could propose to her.

Despite this, the St Bernadette's headteacher Mrs Bevans tasks him with running their nativity play this year, and gives him a new class teaching assistant called Mr Poppy, who turns out to be as much of a child as the rest of Paul's class. As every year, it is one of Paul's other friends from drama school, Gordon Shakespeare, who runs the nativity plays at rival school Oakmoor.

Determined not to be seen as a failure by his old rival, Paul lies to Shakespeare about how a Hollywood producer, their old friend Jennifer, will be turning his production into a Hollywood film, though he hasn't even spoken to her in five years. Mr Poppy accidentally overhears this and is so excited that he has to spread the rumour.

Soon, Paul finds his lie is out of control, and all he can do is go along with it as media attention mounts and the children get more and more excited, so Paul has to try to actually get Hollywood to turn their production to a film.

_Danger in the Manger_ (2012)

Donald Peterson is an anxious teacher who has just moved to a new house with his pregnant wife Sarah. He accepts a teaching job at St. Bernadette's primary school, taking over the class formerly taught by Mr. Maddens, who by this point has left for the United States. In the interim, the enthusiastic and childlike teaching assistant Mr. Poppy has been teaching the class unaided.

The class wants to enter in a competition called "A Song for Christmas", in which each school produces a Christmas song, with the winning song earning its school £10,000 and the chance at being a Christmas #1. However, headteacher Mrs. Bevan refuses the class permission to enter without a qualified teacher, and worries that Mr. Poppy's behaviour is so inappropriate that no teacher will stay in the job.

When Mr. Poppy decides St Bernadette's should enter the National 'Song for Christmas' competition, he persuades Donald to sign the entry forms, later kidnapping him for an impromptu road trip to Gastell Llawen ("Merry Castle", not a real place) in Wales, where the competition is being held.

_Dude, Where's My Donkey?_ (2014)

This movie stars Martin Clunes, Marc Wootton, Catherine Tate with Celia Imrie and Jason Watkins.

Jeremy Shepherd is an Ofsted inspector who is the father of Lauren and is due to marry his fiancée Sophie in New York. However, he is hit in the forehead by Mr Poppy's pet donkey Alfie. He has amnesia, and no memory of anything that happened before.

_Nativity Rocks!_ (2018)

It was confirmed on 4 December 2017 that _Nativity 4_ would be released on Friday 23 November 2018, and would be entitled _Nativity Rocks!_. A teaser trailer was released in July 2018.

Casting included; Simon Lipkin, Daniel Boys, Craig Revel Horwood, Meera Syal, Helen George, Ruth Jones, Celia Imrie, Hugh Dennis, Anna Chancellor, Ramin Karimloo, as well as some of the cast from the original theatre musical cast.[1]

Doru, a child refugee from Syria, is separated from his father as he arrives in the UK. He is moved to Coventry by social worker Miss Shelly and joins St Bernadette's Primary School, where he meets new teaching assistant Jerry Poppy who assists him in his search for his father amid another Christmas musical production for the school, led by impresario Emmanuel Cavendish.[2]

Future

Possible future films

In an interview, Debbie Isitt said _"Nativity 4 has been developed already and so has Nativity 5 – one of them is set ‘Down Under’ in Australia"_. She later added "However, I am uncertain as to if or when they will be made as there are other projects competing for my attention. We will just have to see."[3] The fourth film was released in 2018 - no comment has been made on a potential fifth film since its release.

Declined international remakes

Nick revealed that they had so far "politely declined" offers to make American and Australian remakes.[4]
