One day Rosy makes Ezra to promise in the name of Jesus that he would never leave her alone and marry her even if their family oppose. Rosy was not able to tell Ezra that she was pregnant. So once Ezra wanted to leave to Kochi, he decided to tell his father about his relationship with Rosy so that he can convince Rosy's parents too.

Ezra's father refuses his wish to marry Rosy, since they belong to Jewish community and they marry only a Jewish girl. Ezra is forced to break up with Rosy by his father. Without knowing this, Rosy awaits Ezra to comeback. Months later Rosy showed up signs of pregnancy and she is caught by her mother. Her parents tried to make her understand the situation and asked her to tell who's child was she carrying, but Rosy trusted Ezra and was not ready to betray him so she remain silent and she is locked up in a room by her parents. Without knowing all this conflicts, months later, depressed Ezra writes a letter to Rosy telling her to end their relationships and erase him from her life. In sorrow Rosy commit suicide by wearing the wedding gown which was gifted by Ezra to show that she still love him. Later Rosy's father find the letter which was send by Ezra to Rosy and finds that they were in a relationship. He went to meet Ezra and his father. However, he was killed by Ezra's father. The villagers tried to hit Ezra and they attempted to kill him. Ezra was seriously injured and he was taken to the hospital by his father.

The doctors confirms that he is brain dead . Ezra's father decides to take revenge on the people of the society. Ezra's father purposefully kills him to create Dybbuk. Instead of seeing his son in a brain-dead condition, he invoked black magic and made his son's soul enter into a Dybbuk box. The box was created in such a way that the spirit would destroy the entire community who killed Ezra. He let the others know that Ezra had died and they then buried Ezra's body, which was really a wooden dummy. For the spirit of Ezra to become a Dybbuk, his body could not be given a proper burial. Ezra's father then took Ezra's body, which was wrapped in a cloth, to the sea and dumped it.

The story comes back to Ranjan. Marques wants the Dybbuk to leave Ranjan and his family. So with the help of A.C.P Shafeer Ahammed (Tovino Thomas), he confirms that Abraham Ezra's story is true. Finally, he decides to exorcise the Dybbuk. But, it is revealed that it is not Priya, but Ranjan whom the spirit of Ezra has possessed. Fr. Samuel tell them that Ranjan, as orphan had mental problems in his childhood and because Ranjan is a nuclear waste management specialist, the Dybbuk would be easily able to destroy the society. At last, Ranjan is exorcised but failed. Marques along with other Jews try to control Ezra but Priya is trapped under Ezra but then suddenly looking at pregnant Priya, Ezra remembers Rosy and his love towards her made him to leave Priya. Finally the dybbuk who is uncontrollable is made to enter the box by Marques. The box is then taken to an ocean by Marues and Shafeer and dumped exactly like Ezra'a body was dumped.

Later, Priya gives birth to a healthy baby and she and Ranjan are sharing their happy news with Marques. In a mid credit scene, it is shown that the Dybbuk box is found by some young men who were loafing about the sea shore. The film end by them taking the box with them planning to open it.
