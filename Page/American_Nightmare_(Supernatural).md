Plot

In Iowa, a woman named Olivia walks into a church bleeding and being whipped by something unseen, she dies. Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) talk to her coworker Beth (Aliza Vellani) at Child Protective Services, a Wiccan who is promoted with Olivia dead. Dean thinks it's obvious Beth killed her with a spell and is moody with Mary gone. A local grocery stock boy then dies the same way. The two victims are connected to a deeply religious husband, wife and son who live off grid while their daughter Magda (Paloma Kwiatkowski) died of pneumonia. Sam believes Magda's ghost is doing this while Dean goes to kill Beth. Sam discovers Magda is still alive in the basement and is considered the devil by her family, forced by her mother to whip herself.

Sam is captured as Dean realizes Beth is innocent. Sam learns Magda has psychic abilities and she had reached out to the two victims trying to get their help, not intending to kill them. With their secret exposed, her mother intends for them to poison themselves and die as a family, killing her husband. Magda tries to stop her and her mother accidentally kills her brother. Sam talks her out of murdering her mother who is arrested. Magda is sent to live with an aunt in California with Sam promising to be there for her if she needs help, while Dean accepts Mary needing space. However, at a rest stop, Magda is killed by Mr. Ketch of the British Men of Letters to clean up the Winchester's mess.

Critical reviews

"American Nightmare" received positive reviews. Sean McKenna from _TV Fanatic_, gave a 4.4 star rating out of 5, stating: "So, while I enjoyed 'American Nightmare' overall, it would have been a far better ending to close with Sam and Dean wrapping up their latest case and driving the Impala off down the road."[3]

Bridget LaMonica from _Den of Geek_ wrote: "The climax is the most intense dinner scene in which I was definitely shouting at the TV. Very Jonestown-inspired. Sam was as helpless as the viewer, watching as this family was killed 'for their own good.'"[4]

Amy Ratcliffe from Nerdist wrote, "The Winchesters are down to a party of two again. With Mary gone and taking some time for herself to get used to not being dead, Sam and Dean got back to the family business. (It's how I'd cope, so I don't fault them.) 'American Nightmare' revisited one of the more horrifying monsters in _Supernatural_: humans."[5]
