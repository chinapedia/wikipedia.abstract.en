Career

Chardigny designed many sculptures, some of which are held in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art,[6] the Princeton University Art Museum,[7] the Château de Pau,[8] and the Musée Baron-Martin.[9] Pierre_joseph_chardigny,_alexandre-ange_de_tayllerand-perigord,_arcivescovo_di_parigi,_1821.JPG, designed by Chardigny.]] Chardigny suggested the design of a 100-foot statue in the shape of William Shakespeare in London, where visitors could go in, but it was turned down on the grounds that it would dehumanize him.[10]
