Career

13.Haste-Timber_Wolf_(detail).jpg sculpture.]]

Haste was born in 1971 in Putney, a suburb of south west London, UK, where she grew up.[1][2][3] She graduated from the Wimbledon College of Art in 1990, and in 1993 earned a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in illustration from the Camberwell College of Arts.[4]

Haste went on to graduate from the Royal College of Art,[5] where she first became interested in wire sculpture, using galvanised wire mesh over a steel armature, later on using the wire mesh as sculpting material on its own for indoor work.[6] Haste's sculptures are generally created by building up many layers of wire mesh over the steel armature skeleton, spray finished with enamel paint.[7]

In 1999, her sculpture of a baboon won the BBC Wildlife Art Award.[8]

Kendra Haste lives in Surrey, UK.[9]

Historic Royal Palaces commission

In 2010 Haste was commissioned by Historic Royal Palaces to create a series of pieces, (thirteen in total), which tell the story of the Royal Menagerie that had existed at the Tower of London from 1210 until 1833. Throughout the 600 years that there was a menagerie at the Tower of London, apes and monkeys were always a feature. Baboons roamed the Tower freely until, in 1833, a child was killed by their aggressive behaviour. Soon after, the entire menagerie was moved to Regents Park, to become what is today the London Zoo. Using research from the Tower of London archives, Haste returned the animals to their original locations around the Tower.[10][11][12]

Waterloo Elephant

6.Haste_Waterloo_Elephant.jpg.]] Haste's Waterloo _Elephant_ was originally commissioned by the London Underground as part of its Platform for Art programme and set up at the Gloucester Road tube station. After the success of Haste's "Underground Safari" pieces, the London Underground purchased the African elephant sculpture and installed it near the ticket hall of a new Jubilee line extension at the London Waterloo station. The new location is on the site of the old Astley's Amphitheatre – sometimes considered the world's first circus ring – where in 1828 an elephant that was part of the show was frightened and blundered into the crowd.[13][14]
