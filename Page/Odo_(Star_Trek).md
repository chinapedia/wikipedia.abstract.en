ODO , played by René Auberjonois, is a fictional character in the science fiction television series _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_. He is a member of a shapeshifting species called Changelings and serves as the head of security for the space station Deep Space Nine on which the show is set. Intelligent, observant and taciturn, Odo uses his unique abilities throughout the show to maintain security on the DS9 station and, later, aids the Bajoran people and the Federation throughout the Dominion War against his own people, the Founders.


Overview

Star Trek: Deep Space 9

The original Writer's Bible from 1992 for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine described Odo as follows:

  Odo, an alien male, middle-aged curmudgeon, and a shape-shifter. In his natural state he is a gelatinous liquid. He was a Bajoran law enforcement officer on the space station under the Cardassians. Starfleet decides to have him continue in that role, since he's extremely savvy about the Promenade and all who frequent it. His backstory is: 50 years ago, with no memory of his past, he was found alone in a mysterious spacecraft that appeared in the Denarias asteroid belt. He was found by the Bajoran and lived amongst them. At first he was sort of an Elephant Man, a source of curiosity and humor as he turned himself into a chair or pencil. Finally he realized he would have to take the form of a humanoid to assimilate and function in their environment. He does it, but resents it. As a result, Odo performs a uniquely important role in the ensemble: he is a character who explores and comments on Human values. Because he is forced to pass as one of us, his point of view usually comes with a cynical and critical edge. But he can't quite get it right, this humanoid shape, though he continues to try. So he looks a little unfinished in a way. He's been working on it a long time. Someone might ask him: Why don't you take the form of a younger man. His answer: I would if I could. He has the adopted child syndrome, searching for his own personal identity. Although he doesn't know anything about his species, he is certain that justice is an integral part of their being, because the necessity for it runs through every fiber of his body – a racial memory. That's why he became a law man. He has a couple of Bajoran deputies; he doesn't allow weapons on the Promenade, and once every day he must return to his gelatinous form. [1]

Actor Rene Auberjonous describes Odo as "a very unformed being" who was "trying to get some kind of shape to his life".[2] Co-creator of _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, Michael Piller, speaks of Odo's role within the show as being prompted by needing "a character who represented the traditions of Spock and Data, the outsider who looks in at humanity." [3]

Late in the fifth season, in the episode “Children of Time”, an Odo who has lived an additional 200 years tells the “current” Kira Nerys that he has loved her from the time their friendship first began. With this revelation, Kira and the “current” Odo eventually become a couple.

Mirror Universe

In the Mirror Universe, Odo is the supervisor of the mining complex at Terok Nor. He is a brutal taskmaster over Terran slaves there and tolerates no deviation from his strict rules. Relatively little is known of him, as no one in the Mirror Universe is aware that the wormhole exists or who Odo's people are. During a mining accident, Odo begins an evacuation of the Terran workers from the complex. Julian Bashir, seizing the opportunity to escape, disintegrates him with a disruptor.

In this reality, Odo has his own set of rules called the "Rules of Obedience" and quotes one of the rules in the same way that regular universe Quark would quote his "Rules of Acquisition".

After filming of the episode "Crossover", which was mirror Odo's sole onscreen appearance, actor Rene Auberjonois liked the alternate uniform so much he began wearing it while playing the regular universe version of Odo as well.

Novels

In the initial _Deep Space Nine_ relaunch novels, Odo is succeeded as security chief by Ro Laren, who is working for the Bajoran Militia. He also sent a Jem'Hadar ambassador to the Alpha Quadrant to foster understanding in the Dominion of other cultures, and soon returned to DS9.[4]

In the _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - Millennium_ series of novels, it is revealed that Odo rarely shifted into smaller forms such as insects due to a psychological block from his original "training" under Doctor Mora. The novel series also speculates that the Founders placed a mental block on Odo's abilities to make it difficult for him to alter his face, thus explaining why he can never get faces quite right, even after linking with other Changelings on several occasions.[5]

In the _Star Trek: Terok Nor_ novel _Night of the Wolves_, Odo was found in a spherical module in the Denorios Belt by the Cardassian vessel _Kevalu_, which was under the command of Dalin Malyn Ocett, in 2345.[6]

In the _Star Trek: Typhon Pact_ novel _Raise the Dawn_, Odo returned to the Alpha Quadrant to help Sisko investigate reports that the Typhon Pact, an alliance of the Federation's enemies, have stolen Jem'Hadar technology to perfect their own quantum slipstream drive, only to be trapped in the Alpha Quadrant when the wormhole was seemingly destroyed thanks to Kira's attempt to stop a Typhon Pact ship from using it again. Sisko offered Odo a place on his new ship, the _Robinson_, but the novel ends with Odo deciding to remain on Bajor for a time to think about what he will do next.[7]


Reception

In 2009, IGN ranked Odo as the seventh best character of _Star Trek_ overall.[8] They note the character's search for identity, even as he struggles to maintain order the space station.[9] They highlight his relationships with Sisko, Quark, and Kira on the station, and that he can turn into any shape except a normal human form.[10] In 2016, the Odo was ranked as the 15th most important character of Starfleet within the _Star Trek_ science fiction universe by Wired magazine.[11]

In 2018, The Wrap ranked Odo as the 8th best main-cast character of _Star Trek_ overall, noting his struggles with loyalties.[12]
