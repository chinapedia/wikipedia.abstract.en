Novak Djokovic was the four-time defending champion, but lost to Andy Murray in the final, 3–6, 4–6.

Murray was the top seed at the ATP World Tour Finals for the first time in his career and also attained the year-end no. 1 ranking for the first time by defeating Djokovic in the final.[1][2]

Roger Federer, whose season was curtailed by injury, did not qualify for the ATP year-end finals tournament for the first time since 2001, thus ending his record streak of 14 consecutive appearances. He also fell to number 16 in ATP rankings as a result, the first time he fell out of top 10 since August 12, 2002, thus ending his streak of 734 consecutive weeks in top 10.

Rafael Nadal qualified this year but withdrew due to injury.

Gaël Monfils, Dominic Thiem and David Goffin (as an alternate replacing Monfils) made their debuts in the event.
