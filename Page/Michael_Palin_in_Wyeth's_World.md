_MICHAEL PALIN IN WYETH'S WORLD_ is a 2013 British documentary film directed by Eleanor Yule and featuring Michael Palin. It is about the American painter Andrew Wyeth and the people who inspired his paintings.


Production

The film was part of a series of collaborations between Michael Palin, the director Eleanor Yule and the producer Mhairi McNeill. They began to discuss the project five years before it was made. It was filmed during three weeks in the autumn of 2013 in Pennsylvania and Maine.[1]


Reception

Yolanda Zappaterra wrote in _Time Out London_: "It's a fascinating life and, containing as it does interviews with Helga, Andrew's son and painter Jamie Wyeth, and Andrew himself before his death in 2009. A real treat â€“ particularly if you're as ignorant of Wyeth's world as we were."[2] _The Independent_'s Gerard Gilbert called the film "unexpectedly absorbing".[3] John Crace of _The Guardian_ wrote that "_Michael Palin in Wyeth's World_ (BBC2) was a little gem; a one-hour documentary about a 20th-century American painter, Andrew Wyeth, of whom I had never heard, yet which kept me intrigued".[4]
