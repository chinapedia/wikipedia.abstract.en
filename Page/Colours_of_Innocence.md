Synopsis

10-year-old Gopal’s carefree childhood is disrupted when his father meets with an accident. It becomes difficult for his mother to feed him and his little brother Chottu. Gopal starts devising ways to earn money. With a little assistance from Chottu he takes up odd jobs from cleaning wells to selling laboriously plucked fruits in the local village market. Emboldened by his initial success, Gopal fancies himself as the breadwinner of the family. Meanwhile, a grand Janmashtami feast is being planned in the Brahmin household where the pulao will be served. Hearing this both the brothers hatch plans of their own. Gopal would like to make a quick buck by selling palmyras for the feast, while Chottu starts dreaming of this fancy dish that he has never seen or tasted. After all he has heard that the whole village will be invited. But as a disheartening reality Gopal and Chhotu were not chosen to be invited. It shattered Chhotu's dream world.

Development

This film is the debut film of Manas Mukul Pal as director.

Filming

Shooting for the film started from August 2015. To capture the seasons of rural Bengal, the film was shot in three different seasons - post monsoon, Autumn and Spring. The locations for shooting were chosen as the interiors of Bengal villages near Bolpur in Birbhum district and Piyali in South 24 Parganas. Manas started this film with fresh faces chosen by himself from the interiors of rural West Bengal. According to him, "I went to many schools in the villages of North and South 24 pargana districts to find the suitable faces for the film. I did not want to use any of the polished urban child as the main protagonists of this film. Noor and Aminul were found in such village schools and I groomed them keeping in my own house for months." Almost everybody related to this film were on their first assignment for the big screen. So, an honest, passionate and dedicated work was possible and that became the key of success.
