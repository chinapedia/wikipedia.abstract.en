KRISTIN RUSSO (born December 17, 1980) is an American speaker, personality, and LGBTQ activist. She is CEO and Editor-in-Chief of _Everyone Is Gay_[1] and _My Kid Is Gay_[2]_,_ organizations that provide advice, guidance, and education to LGBTQIA youth and their families, and is the co-author of _This Is a Book for Parents of Gay Kids_[3] (Chronicle, 2014).


Education

Russo received her Bachelor of Arts in Theatre in 2002 from Marymount Manhattan College in New York City. She later went on to receive her Masters of Arts in Gender and Sexuality Studies from CUNY Grad Center in 2012.[4]


Work

In 2010, Russo and former business partner Dannielle Owens-Reid launched _Everyone Is Gay_[5] as a Tumblr presence.[6] Russo began providing regular written advice for LGBTQIA youth's regularly submitted questions, and later that same year began to make video responses to these questions interspersed with lip-sync numbers.

In 2013, Russo and Owens-Reid began _My Kid Is Gay_ (formerly _The Parents Project_,)[7] a first-of-its-kind digital resource for families and educators of LGBTQIA people. _My Kid Is Gay_ provides advice from parents, youth, and experts about topics related to gender identity and sexuality. This project was inspired during the writing of T_his Is a Book for Parents of Gay Kids_ which was released in 2014 by Chronicle Books. _This Is a Book for Parents of Gay Kids_[8] was written as an accessible, relatable, and non-clinical guide parents could turn to for contemporary answers to their questions. The book received glowing accolades from The Ellen Show,[9] National Public Radio (NPR),[10] Autostraddle,[11] The Advocate,[12] and many others.

In 2015, Russo hosted and produced the premiere season of _First Person_,[13] a digital video series on sexuality and gender from WNET and PBS Digital Studios.[14] In the series, Russo interviewed individuals whose lives intersected with issues related to gender identity and sexuality.

In 2016, Russo took on the role of CEO & Editor-in-Chief of both _Everyone Is Gay_ & _My Kid Is Gay_. She continues to speak at school campuses & community centers, and in February 2016 began a new _Everyone Is Gay_ video series (hosted on YouTube and broadcast live on Facebook) called "Getting In Bed with Kristin," where she answers advice and speaks with notable guests from the LGBTQ community on issues related to sexuality and gender.

Russo also co-directs a queer adult sleep-away camp founded and hosted by Autostraddle, called A-Camp.[15]


Buffering The Vampire Slayer

In September 2016, Russo launched the podcast Buffering The Vampire Slayer with musician Jenny Owen Youngs. The podcast discusses the popular television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer one episode at a time, and each episode ends with an original recap song about the episode, penned by Youngs and Russo.[16] The podcast is part of the Stitcher Premium network and has been featured in A.V. Club,[17] Entertainment Weekly,[18] Autostraddle,[19] and Buzzfeed.[20]


Personal life

Russo married musician and songwriter Jenny Owen Youngs on August 25, 2013.[21] On May 25, 2018, the couple announced they are no longer together but remain friends and will keep working in their mutual projects. Both of them said, "We’ve come to realize that we will be better—both to ourselves and to each other—within the context of a friendship, rather than a marriage."
