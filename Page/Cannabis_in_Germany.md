Hanflabyrinth_Berlin_2009_-_17.jpg CANNABIS IN GERMANY is legal for certain limited medical contexts, but illegal for recreational usage, though possession of minor amounts is not always prosecuted.


Medical cannabis

Dronabinol was rescheduled in 1994 from annex I to annex II of the Narcotics Law (_Betäubungsmittelgesetz_) in order to ease research; in 1998 dronabinol was rescheduled from annex II to annex III and since then has been available by prescription.[1] whereas Δ⁹-THC is still listed in annex I.[2] Manufacturing instructions for dronabinol containing compendial formulations are described in the _Neues Rezeptur-Formularium_.[3]

Although Δ⁹-THC is still listed in annex I,[4] in a few cases, patients have been able to obtain from the federal drug authority a special permit to import natural cannabis through a pharmacy. Manufacturing instructions for dronabinol containing compendial formulations are described in the _Neues Rezeptur-Formularium_.[5]

In February 2008, seven German patients were legally being treated with medicinal cannabis, distributed by prescription in pharmacies.[6]

On May 4, 2016 the Cabinet of Germany approved legislation allowing the use of cannabis for seriously ill patients who have consulted with a doctor and "have no therapeutic alternative". German Health Minister, Hermann Gröhe, presented the legal draft on the legalization of medical cannabis to the cabinet which took effect on March 10, 2017. Licenses will be given by "Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices" to companies for growing medical cannabis.[7][8][9][10][11] As of March 2017, the seriously ill can obtain cannabis with a doctor's prescription, paid for by health insurance.[12]


Enforcement

Munich_-_cannabis_legalization_stall.jpg The German narcotics law (Betäubungsmittelgesetz) states that authorities are not required to prosecute for the possession of a "minor amount" of any narcotic drug meant for personal consumption, except in cases _"of public interest"_, i.e. consumption in public, in front of minors or within a public school or a state prison.[13] The definition of "minor amount" varies, from up to 6 grams of cannabis in most states to 15 grams in Berlin.[14]

Under German law, the consumption itself of narcotics is not illegal: legally speaking, it is considered as non-punishable self harm. Legal commentaries recognise that it is possible to consume drugs without having bought them first, in a legal sense. This has the practical effect that a positive drug test does not necessarily mean that one has illegally purchased them.[15]

Despite the fact that there is no punishment de jure, consumers can be assessed psychological (MPU) for their driving suitability. Loss of drivers licence is not uncommon, followed by a regime of drug screenings to prove the suitability.

Hemp food

Non-psychoactive foods made with hemp seeds (less than 0.2% THC) are very common in German health food shops such as Reformhaus.
