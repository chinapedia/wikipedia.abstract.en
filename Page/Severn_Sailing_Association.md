History

The Association was incorporated on October 28th, 1954 by John J. Hopkins, Richard C. Bartlett, and Robert F. Podlich. The founding members consisted of a group of about thirty people who wished to establish a sailing club on Chesapeake Bay.[2] Not finding a site for the club, two members of the Board of Governors asked Stuart H. Walker, leader of one of the club's constituent fleets, to stand for Commodore at the 1956 Annual Meeting and to keep trying. In 1957 he was reported that three small cottages on the water at the end of First Street in Eastport were for sale, and the club settled there. In 1958, a dock was constructed and the boats of the five initial centerboard fleets (Penguins, Comets, National One-Designs, Severn One-Designs and International 14's) were launched.[3]
