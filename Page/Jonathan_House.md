JONATHAN M. HOUSE (born June 22, 1950) is an American military historian and author. He is a professor emeritus of military history at the United States Army Command and General Staff College. House is a leading authority on Soviet military history, with an emphasis upon World War II and the Soviet influence upon modern operational doctrine. Together with David Glantz, he wrote multiple books on the Red Army operations on the Eastern Front, most notably _When Titans Clashed: How the Red Army Stopped Hitler_.[1]


Education and career

A 1971 graduate of Hamilton College, in 1975 House completed his history doctorate and was commissioned out of Army ROTC at the University of Michigan. After numerous courses at the U.S. Army Intelligence Center and School (1978, 1979–80), he completed masters degrees in strategy (Command and General Staff College, 1984) and intelligence (King's College London, 2017). As a junior officer, he taught at the army's Armor School, Intelligence Center and School, and Command and General Staff College.

House served as an intelligence analyst for the Joint Chiefs of Staff at The Pentagon during both the 1991 and 2003 conflicts with Iraq. He retired as a colonel of military intelligence. House is the author of _Toward Combined Arms Warfare: a Survey of 20th-century Tactics, Doctrine, and Organization_ (1984) _A Military History of the Cold War, 1944-1962_ (2012), and _Controlling Paris: Armed Forces and Counter-Revolution, 1789-1848_ (2014).[2]


Historian of German-Soviet War, 1941–1945

Together with David Glantz, House co-authored several books on the military history of the Eastern Front, including _The Battle of Kursk_ (1999); _To the Gates of Stalingrad: Soviet-German combat operations, April–August 1942_ (2009); _Armageddon in Stalingrad: September–November 1942_ (2009); and _Endgame at Stalingrad_ (2014). In 1917, House was the primary author of a consolidated volume entitled simply _Stalingrad._ All books were published by the University Press of Kansas.[3]

Their first collaboration, _When Titans Clashed_, was described upon initial publication in 1995 in an H-Net review as "belong[ing] in every college library and on the shelves of all World War II historians".[4] The book was reissued in 2015 in an expanded edition; it was described by the military historian Steven Zaloga as "the best overview of the combat record of the Red Army in the Second World War".[5]
