_SIMCITY_ (later renamed _SIMCITY CLASSIC_)[1] is a city-building simulation video game, designed by Will Wright, published by Maxis, and released on 2 February 1989,[2][3] it is the first game in the _SimCity_ series. The game focuses on players operating as a mayor whose task is to build up a city, providing basic transit links, power, and simplistic service needs for their residents, while watching out for problems and dealing with a multitude of disasters, most of which are based on real-life disasters. Alongside the option to make a city from scratch, the game also features scenarios that task players to oversee a pre-built city and deal with specific issues that it faces, most of which require the player to rebuild after a disaster.

Released initially for the Commodore Amiga and Macintosh computer, the game was ported onto various gaming platforms. _SimCity_ received critical acclaim upon release, becoming a commercial success and establishing the title as one of the all-time greats in city-building simulation games, spawning several sequels as a result - _SimCity 2000_ in 1993, _SimCity 3000_ in 1999, _SimCity 4_ in 2003, _SimCity DS_, _SimCity Societies_ in 2007, and _SimCity_ in 2013. The game became the best-selling Maxis title on PC, until the eventual release of the series spin-off _The Sims_ in 2000.


Gameplay

The objective of _SimCity_ is to build and design a city, without specific goals to achieve. The player can mark land as being zoned as commercial, industrial, or residential, add buildings, change the tax rate, build a power grid, build transportation systems and take many other actions, in order to enhance the city. Once able to construct buildings in a particular area, the too-small-to-see residents, known as "Sims",[4] may choose to construct and upgrade houses, apartment blocks, light or heavy industrial buildings, commercial buildings, hospitals, churches, and other structures. The Sims make these choices based on such factors as traffic levels, adequate electrical power, crime levels, and proximity to other types of buildings—for example, residential areas next to a power plant will seldom appreciate to the highest grade of housing.[5] In the Super NES version and later, the player can also build rewards when they are given to them, such as a mayor's mansion or a casino.

The player may face disasters including flooding, tornadoes, fires (often from air disasters or shipwrecks), earthquakes and attacks by monsters. In addition, monsters and tornadoes can trigger train crashes by running into passing trains.

Scenarios

_SimCity_ includes goal-centered, timed scenarios that could be won or lost depending on the performance of the player. The scenarios were an addition suggested by Brøderbund in order to make _SimCity_ more like a game.[6] The original cities were based on real world cities and attempted to re-create their general layout. While most scenarios either take place in a fictional timeline or have a city under siege by a fictional disaster, a handful of available scenarios are based on actual historical events.


Development

Micropolis_-_big_city.png _SimCity_ was developed by game designer Will Wright. While working on the game _Raid on Bungeling Bay_, in which the player flies a helicopter dropping bombs on islands, Wright found he enjoyed designing the islands in the level editor more than playing the actual game.[7] This led him to develop increasingly sophisticated level editors.[8] At the same time, Wright was cultivating a love of the intricacies and theories of urban planning[9] and acknowledges the influence of System Dynamics which was developed by Jay Wright Forrester and whose book on the subject[10] laid the foundations for what would become _SimCity_.[11] In addition, Wright also was inspired by reading "The Seventh Sally", a short story from _The Cyberiad_ by Stanisław Lem, in which an engineer encounters a deposed tyrant, and creates a miniature city with artificial citizens for the tyrant to oppress.[12] The game reflected Wright's approval of mass transit and disapproval of nuclear power; Maxis president Jeff Braun stated "We're pushing political agendas".[13]

The first version of the game was developed for the Commodore 64 in 1985; it was not published for another four years.[14] The original working title of SimCity was _Micropolis_.[15] The game was unusual in that it could neither be won nor lost; as a result, game publishers did not believe it was possible to market and sell such a game successfully. Brøderbund declined to publish the title when Wright proposed it, and he pitched it to a range of major game publishers without success. Finally, Braun, founder of the tiny software company Maxis, agreed to publish _SimCity_ as one of two initial games for the company.[16]

Wright and Braun returned to Brøderbund to formally clear the rights to the game in 1988, when _SimCity_ was near completion. After Brøderbund executives Gary Carlston and Don Daglow saw _SimCity_, they signed Maxis to a distribution deal for both of its initial games. With that, four years after initial development, _SimCity_ was released for the Amiga and Macintosh platforms, followed by the IBM PC and Commodore 64 later in 1989.[17]


Ports and versions

SimCity-Indigo.gif workstation]] After the original release on the Amiga and Macintosh, then the Commodore 64 and IBM PC, it was ported to several other computer platforms and video game consoles, specifically the Atari ST, Acorn Archimedes, Amstrad CPC, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, Super Nintendo Entertainment System (which was later released on Virtual Console), EPOC32, mobile phone, Internet, Windows, FM-Towns, OLPC XO-1 and NeWS HyperLook on Sun Unix. The game is available as a multiplayer version for X11 TCL/Tk on various Unix, Linux, DESQview and OS/2 operating systems. Certain versions have been re-released with various add-ons, including extra scenarios. An additional extra add on for the Windows version of _SimCity Classic_ was a level editor. This editor could be opened without use of the disc. The level editor is a simple tool that allows the user to create grasslands, dirt land, and water portions.

A version was developed in 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, but never released; a prototype version was found in 2017.[18] On December 25, 2018, a ROM image of the unreleased NES version was released online by Frank Cifaldi of the Video Game History Foundation.[19]

The IBM version of _SimCity_ is notable for the unusually large amount of graphics modes it supports; the game runs in CGA 640x200 mode, EGA 640x200 mode (for users with 200-line monitors), Tandy 640x200 mode, Hercules, EGA 640x350 mode (for users with 350-line monitors) and VGA 640x480 monochrome. A later release dropped all of the 200-line modes and added 640x480 color mode. Unlike most commercial PC games at the time, 320x200 resolutions were not used because they were inadequate for the amount of graphics detail the game needed. A port of _SimCity_ was released for Windows 3.0 in 1992. It runs in the Windows GDI and does not support 256-color graphics or sound.

Super NES

_SimCity_ for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) features the same gameplay and scenario features; however, since it was developed and published by Nintendo, the company incorporated their own ideas. Instead of the Godzilla monster disaster, Bowser of the _Super Mario_ series becomes the attacking monster, and once the city reaches a landmark 500,000 populace, the player receives a Mario statue that is placeable in the city. The Super NES port also features special buildings the player may receive as rewards, such as casinos, large parks, amusement parks, and expo centers; some of which would be incorporated into _SimCity 2000_. A bank can be built which will allow a loan of $10,000 to be taken, but it must be paid back before another loan can be taken out. The game includes schools and hospitals, though they cannot be placed by the player; instead, the game will sometimes turn an empty residential lot into one. There are city classifications, such as becoming a metropolis at 100,000 people. It has some of the same pre-set scenarios in the PC and Mac versions and two new ones. One is in Las Vegas under attack by aliens and another called Freeland. Freeland has no water and no rewards buildings are given. Also unique to the Super NES version is a character named "Dr. Wright" (whose physical appearance is based on Will Wright) who acts as an adviser to the player. The soundtrack was composed by Soyo Oka. The edition is featured as Nintendo's Player's Choice as a million seller.

In August 1996 a version of the game entitled _BS Sim City Machizukuri Taikai_ was broadcast to Japanese players via the Super Famicom's Satellaview subsystem. Later, a sequel titled _SimCity 64_ was released for Nintendo 64DD, the Japan-only Nintendo 64 add-on.

Cancelled NES version

A version for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was announced alongside the SNES version, and had been showcased at the 1991 Consumer Electronics Show, but the NES version was never properly released. However, prototype cartridges for the NES version were discovered in 2017, and one copy was obtained by video game preservationist Frank Cifaldi, who extensively documented its features compared to the original personal computer game and the SNES version.[20][21] It featured a completely different soundtrack (also composed by Oka) than the SNES version;[22] besides _Metropolis Theme_,[23] a composition that Oka herself considers one of her best works.[24]

_Micropolis_

In January 2008, the _SimCity_ source code was released under the free software GPL 3 license [25][26][27], renamed to _Micropolis_ (the original working title) for trademark reasons, and developed by Don Hopkins. The release of the source code was motivated by the One Laptop Per Child program. The _Micropolis_ source code has been translated to C++, integrated with Python and interfaced with both GTK+ and OpenLaszlo.[28]

In 2008, Maxis established an online browser-based version of _SimCity_.[29] A second browser-based version was later released under the name _Micropolis_.[30] In 2013, a browser-based version was released, ported using JavaScript and HTML5, as _micropolisJS_.[31]

Since _Micropolis_ is licensed under the GPL, users can do anything they want with it that conforms with the GPLthe only restriction is that they cannot call it "SimCity" (along with a few other limitations to protect EA's trademarks).[32] This allows other, differently named projects to be forked from the Micropolis source code. Improvements to the open source code base that merits EA's approval may be incorporated into the official "OLPC SimCity" source code, to be distributed with the OLPC under the trademarked name _OLPC SimCity_, but only after it has been reviewed and approved by EA.[33]

In addition, the Super NES version of _SimCity_ had two additional bonus scenarios, accessible when the original scenarios were completed: Las Vegas and Freeland (see section on scenarios). The style of the buildings also resemble those in Japan rather than those of North America. |

-   _SimCity Classic_ is available for Palm OS and on the SimCity.com website as _Classic Live_. It was also released by Atelier Software for the Psion 5 handheld computer, and mobile phones in 2006.[39]
-   The July 2005 issue of _Nintendo Power_ stated that a development cartridge of _SimCity_ for the NES was found at Nintendo headquarters. Never released, it is reportedly the only one in existence.
-   Additionally a terrain editor and architecture disks were available with tileset graphics for settings of Ancient Asia, Medieval, Wild West, Future Europe, Future USA and a Moon Colony.
-   Versions of _SimCity_ for the BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, and Acorn Archimedes computers were published by Superior Software/Acornsoft. Programmer Peter Scott had to squeeze the 512k Amiga version of the game into 20k in order to run on the ageing 32k BBC Micro and Acorn Electron. Despite this, it kept almost all of the functionality of the Amiga game and very similar graphics (although only using four colours).
-   DUX Software published a Unix version of _SimCity_ for the NeWS window system using the HyperLook user interface environment, and a multi-player version of _SimCity_ for the X11 window system using the TCL/Tk user interface toolkit, both developed and ported to various platforms by Don Hopkins.


Reception

_SimCity_ was a financial success, selling one million copies by late 1992. In the United States, it was the ninth best-selling computer game from 1993 to 1999, with another 830,000 units sold.[40] It was critically acclaimed and received significant recognition within a year after its initial release. As of December 1990 the game was reported to have won the following awards:

In addition, _SimCity_ won the Origins Award for "Best Military or Strategy Computer Game" of 1989 in 1990,[45] was named to _Computer Gaming World_{{'}}s Hall of Fame for games readers highly rated over time,[46] and the multiplayer X11 version of the game was also nominated in 1992 as the Best Product of the Year in _Unix World_. _SimCity_ was named #4 "Ten Greatest PC Game Ever" by PC World in 2009.[47] It was named one of the sixteen most influential games in history at Telespiele, a German technology and games trade show, in 2007.[48] Sid Meier in 2008 named _SimCity_ as one of the three most important innovations in videogame history, as it led to other games that encouraged players to create, not destroy.[49] It was named #11 on IGN's 2009 "Top 25 PC Games of All Time" list.[50] In 1996, _Computer Gaming World_ declared _SimCity_ the 6th-best computer game ever released.[51]

_Entertainment Weekly_ gave the game an B+.[52]

In 1991, _PC Format_ named _SimCity_ one of the 50 best computer games ever. The editors called it "a town planner's dream".[53]

The University of Southern California and University of Arizona used _SimCity_ in urban planning and political science classes. In 1990 The _Providence Journal_ invited five candidates for Mayor of Providence, Rhode Island to manage a _SimCity_ town resembling the city; former mayor Buddy Cianci, who was the most successful, won election that year. Chuck Moss of _The Detroit News_ found that Godzilla attacking the city in the 1972 Detroit scenario caused less destruction than the mayoralty of Coleman Young.[54]

The _SimCity Terrain Editor_ was reviewed in 1989 in _Dragon_ #147 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the expansion 4 out of 5 stars.[55]

The ZX Spectrum version was voted number 4 in the _Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time_.[56]

On March 12, 2007, _The New York Times_ reported that _SimCity_ was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time, the so-called game canon.[57] The Library of Congress took up a video game preservation proposal and began with the games from this list, including _SimCity_.[58][59]


Legacy

_SimCity_ yielded several sequels. "Sim" games of many types were developedwith Will Wright and Maxis developing myriad titles including _SimEarth_, _SimFarm_, _SimTown_, _Streets of SimCity_, _SimCopter_, _SimAnt_, _SimLife_, _SimIsle_, _SimTower_, _SimPark_, _SimSafari_, and _The Sims_, as well as the unreleased _SimsVille_ and _SimMars._ They also obtained licenses for some titles developed in Japan, such as _SimTower_ and _Let's Take The A-Train_ (released as _A-Train_ outside Japan). In 2000 _The Sims_ was released, which spawned its own series. _Spore_, released in 2008, was originally going to be titled "_SimEverything_"a name that Will Wright thought might accurately describe what he was trying to achieve.

_SimCity_ inspired a new genre of video games. "Software toys" that were open-ended with no set objective were developed trying to duplicate _SimCity_'s success. The most successful was most definitely Wright's own _The Sims_, which went on to be the best selling computer game of all time. The ideas pioneered in _SimCity_ have been incorporated into real-world applications as well. For example, VisitorVille simulates a city based on website statistics.

The series also spawned a _SimCity_ collectible card game, produced by Mayfair Games. Rick Swan reviewed _Sim City: The Card Game_ for _Dragon_ magazine #221 (September 1995).[60] Swan says that "While the card game doesn't scale the heights of the computer game, it comes close."[61]

Dr. Wright from the Super NES version has made appearances in several video games. He is a non-player character in _The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening_, and an assist trophy in the _Super Smash Bros._ series.
