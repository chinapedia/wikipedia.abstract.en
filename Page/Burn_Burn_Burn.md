_BURN BURN BURN_ is a 2015 British black comedy film, the directorial debut of Chanya Button.[1] The film is a coming-of-age tale, written by Charlie Covell and inspired by the Jack Kerouac novel _On the Road_ published in 1957. The fictional plot follows the story of two girls, Seph (Laura Carmichael) and Alex (Chloe Pirrie), taking a road trip to follow the instructions of their close friend Dan, who has died and given them instructions where to scatter his ashes. The ashes (stored in tupperware in the glove compartment) keep diminishing in quantity as the trip progresses. The film had its World premiere at the BFI London Film Festival 2015.[2][3]


Reception

Writing in _The Guardian_, Peter Bradshaw described the film as "a sort of millennials mashup of _Laughter in Paradise_ and _Last Orders_."[4] Bradshaw notes that, "It's not the most original premise, but it's very nicely acted by Carmichael and Perrie (who was the lead in Scott Graham’s 2012 movie Shell). There are some great cameos from Julian Rhind-Tutt and Alison Steadman, and some startling moments, such as the surreal scene in which Alex has to play the crucified Christ in an am-dram production of the Passion, and makes a personal confession from the cross".[5]

_The Guardian_ critic, Wendy Ide added, "The approach is a blend of comedy of discomfort – a brilliant cameo by Julian Rhind-Tutt is mortifyingly funny – and sober reflection on lives that have reached a turning point. It's not wholly original, but _Burn Burn Burn_ is nicely acted and emotionally authentic. Button shows real promise as a director".[6]

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an audience score average rating of 3.7/5 based on 64 reviews.[7]
