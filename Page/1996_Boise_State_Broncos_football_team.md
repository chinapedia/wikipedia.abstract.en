The 1996 BOISE STATE BRONCOS FOOTBALL TEAM represented Boise State University in the 1996 NCAA Division I-A football season, their first in Division I-A. The Broncos competed in the Big West Conference and played their home games at Bronco Stadium in Boise, Idaho. Led by fourth-year head coach Pokey Allen and interim head coach Tom Mason, Boise State finished the season 2–10 and 1–4 in conference play.

Diagnosed with a rare and aggressive muscle cancer (rhabdomyosarcoma) shortly after the 1994 season,[1] Pokey Allen underwent surgery in August 1996,[2] then returned to coach the final two games of the season.[3] While visiting relatives in Montana over the holidays,[4] Allen's condition worsened and he died on December 30.[5][6][7][8]
