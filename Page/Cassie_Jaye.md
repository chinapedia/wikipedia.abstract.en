CASSIE JAYE (born May 1, 1986) is an American film director and ex-feminist, best known for directing the 2016 documentary film _The Red Pill_ about the men's rights movement.[1][2]


Early life and work

Jaye was born in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, United States, to Nena Jaye.[3] At age eighteen, she moved to Los Angeles, where she was an actress for five years before moving to Marin County, California in 2008.[4] Jaye disliked the stereotypical roles she was cast in, which she described as "cute girl-next-door who always died in horror films." Along with several incidents of sexual harassment, this led her to embrace feminism. She formed the production company Jaye Bird Productions in 2008.[5]


Career

_Daddy I Do_

Jaye directed and produced the 2010 American documentary film _Daddy I Do_ which examines sex education and sexual abstinence programs in America.[6] _Daddy I Do_ included interviews with the founder of the Silver Ring Thing Denny Pattyn, feminist writer Amanda Marcotte, and Douglas Kirby. The film also discusses personal stories from women facing teenage pregnancy, single motherhood, abortion and sexual assault.[7][8] _Bust_ magazine praised "Jaye for exposing the truth about abstinence-only programs, the stories of teenagers who buy into it, and its consequences..." [9]

_The Right to Love: An American Family_

Jaye directed and produced her second feature documentary film _The Right to Love: An American Family_ in 2012. The film chronicles a family known as "Gay Family Values" on YouTube in the aftermath of California Proposition 8 (2008).[10]

The film premiered in February 2012 at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, California with guest speaker Zach Wahls.[11][12] The film went on to screen at the Frameline Film Festival.[13]

_The Red Pill_

Jaye directed and produced the 2016 American documentary film _The Red Pill_ about the men's rights movement. Jaye spent a year interviewing men's rights figures, such as Paul Elam, founder of A Voice for Men; Harry Crouch, president of the National Coalition for Men; Warren Farrell, author of _The Myth of Male Power_;[14] and Erin Pizzey, who started the first domestic violence shelter in the modern world.[15] She also interviewed critics of the movement, such as _Ms._ magazine executive editor Katherine Spillar,[16][17] and sociologist Michael Kimmel.[18] Jaye initially relied on her own money to fund the film, as well that from her mother and her boyfriend[19] as she found difficulty finding backers from traditional sources after it became known that the film would take a "balanced approach"[20] view of the men's rights movement.[21][22] In what she called a "last resort", she started a campaign on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.[23] The Kickstarter project promised to be a fair and balanced look at the men's rights movement.[24] Her effort was strongly criticized by some feminists[25] including David Futrelle, who runs a website called _We Hunted the Mammoth_ who said it looked like propaganda.[26] However she received support from Breitbart News columnist Milo Yiannopoulos.[27][28][29]

David Futrelle also accused Jaye of soliciting funding from members of the men's rights movement which she portrays sympathetically.[30][31] She has said that the suggestion the film was funded by MRAs (men's rights activists) is "a common lie that keeps spreading,"[32] and that the film's backers and producers would have no influence or control of the film.[33][34] It has also been criticized by Alan Scherstuhl of _The Village Voice_, among others, for failing to challenge controversial comments and behavior from men's rights figures such as Paul Elam.[35][36] Jaye has defended the film as being "extremely balanced" and that people were "heard in context without manipulation".[37]

The film has had screenings canceled in Australia following petitions, protests, and threats against those holding the screening.[38][39][40][41][42][43]

In a 2017 interview with Australian TV show _The Project_, when asked about a recent high-profile murder of Luke Anderson by his father, Jaye emphasized that it was a specific example of a male victim of domestic abuse, instead of as an example of a male perpetrator. Jaye described the interview as "hostile and aggressive", and initially pulled out of some interviews following the incident.[44][45] Later she resumed interviews but made her own recording of the discussions as she stated she had been "misquoted so much".[46]

In an interview on the Australian TV show _Weekend Sunrise_, Jaye asked the show's hosts directly "Did you see the film?". The co-hosts said they had not.[47][48] After receiving a wave of comments critical of the hosts and supporting Jaye, Sunrise removed the video of the interview from their Facebook page. Jaye uploaded the interview to her own page, where it was removed shortly after as a copyright violation. When asked about the removal from Facebook a spokeswoman for the Seven network which produces Sunrise declined to comment. Jaye also posted screenshots of emails to prove that Sunrise’s producer had received a copy of the film a month before the interview and plenty of time for the hosts to have watched it. This was to disprove the hosts' claim that they did not receive a copy of the film.[49]

At the end of the film, Jaye states that she no longer identifies as a feminist,[50] saying that she now believes that "feminism is not the road to gender equality". Although she no longer calls herself a feminist, she has stated that she is "still an advocate of women's rights and always will be" but is now "adding men to the discussion."[51]
