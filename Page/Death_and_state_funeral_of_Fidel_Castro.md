The former President and First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, Fidel Castro died of natural causes at 22:29 (CST) in the evening of 25 November 2016. His brother, the then-President and current First Secretary Raúl Castro, made an announcement about his death on state television.[1] Most foreign government officials, most notably in Latin America, Africa, and South Asia, praised Castro for improving healthcare and education for Cuba's rural poor, opposing international racism, and standing up to US hegemony in the Western Hemisphere while others, especially in the US, Europe, and Canada were more critical of his legacy, saying he was an evil tyrant who drove the Cuban economy to the ground and quelled all opposition to his rule. Some officials gave more neutral condolences while others issued statements about positive binational relations with Cuba (South Africa, Namibia, and Angola praised Castro for ending apartheid in South Africa and freeing Namibia in order to reinforce Mandela's common cause with Castro in fighting racism). Castro's body was cremated and his ashes were interred in Santiago de Cuba on 4 December 2016, and hundreds of thousands of Cubans commemorated the event.


Background

Fidel_90_años_DSC01814_(38335422541).jpg In April 2016, Castro told the Communist Party: "I'll be 90 years old soon. Soon, I'll be like all the others. The time will come for all of us, but the ideas of the Cuban communists will remain as proof on this planet that if they are worked at with fervour and dignity, they can produce the material and cultural goods that human beings need, and we need to fight without truce to obtain them."[2] In February 2016, his older brother Ramón died at the age of 91.

Castro's death was expected in South Florida, with media and governments expecting and hoping that it would cause chaotic celebrations and regime change plans. The city of Miami had planned to open the Orange Bowl Stadium for celebrations; schools might have dismissed early; and police and government officials might have blocked boat piers to prevent Cuban exiles from trying to invade the island. The _Miami Herald_ created a "Cuba plan" more than 20 years before Castro's death; as much as 60 pages in length, it included multiple newspaper extras and reporters joining the United States Coast Guard as it handled the expected large number of refugees fleeing the island. Its journalists prepared to surreptitiously enter Cuba; employees knew that Castro's death would interrupt any vacation or weekend. After Raúl Castro became the country's leader and visiting Cuba became easier, such plans became less important.[3][4][5]


Funeral

{{ external media | video1 = | video2 = }} Following Castro's death, his brother Raúl Castro announced: "According to the will expressed by comrade Fidel, his body will be cremated in the early hours" of 26 November 2016.[6] The cremation was a private affair, with only state and party officials attending together with Fidel's family and friends.

The casket carrying his ashes then lay in state for Cubans to pay homage to Castro at the José Martí Memorial in Havana on 28 and 29 November.[7] A memorial rally then took place at the Plaza de la Revolución[8] at 19:00 on 29 November[9] in which President Raúl Castro as well as various world leaders who were allies of Castro paid tribute, including the presidents of Panama,[10] Mexico, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela and South Africa, along with the prime minister of Greece and leaders of a host of smaller countries in Africa.[11] From 29 November to 3 December the casket carrying his ashes travelled along a 900 kilometres route to Santiago de Cuba, tracing in reverse the route of the "Freedom Caravan" of January 1959 in which Castro and his rebels took power.[12][13] At one point, the jeep broke down and had to be pushed by attending soldiers.[14]

On 3 December at 19:00, another mass gathering took place at Plaza Antonio Maceo in Santiago de Cuba and Raúl and other foreign leaders and dignitaries People waved the flag of Cuba and sang the national anthem. Raúl Castro said in a final speech that Castro showed it was "possible to firmly maintain the inalienable principles of our sovereignty without fear to the nuclear blackmail of the United States during those days of the missile crisis in October 1962." He further added that in Castro's images and statues will not be displayed in public places and roads will not be named after him. "The leader of the revolution strongly opposed any manifestation of cult of personality."[15][16] again paid tribute to Fidel.[17] The next day, 4 December at 7:00, the interment of Castro's ashes occurred in a private ceremony in Santa Ifigenia Cemetery in Santiago de Cuba, where Cuban national hero José Martí is also buried.[18][19] As a camouflage-green hearse went to the cemetery, mourners lined the streets and cheered Viva Fidel!" and “Yo Soy, Fidel!" A secretly constructed tomb was also at the venue. Final events occurred as a 21-gun salute was fired and the ashes, in a coffin wrapped in Cuban flag, disappeared from public view as television cameras and journalists were not allowed inside, save for cameramen from the Sistema Informativo de la Televisión, which provided the live coverage for television channels islandwide.[20]

Foreign dignitaries attending the state funeral

Most states sent delegations led by high or mid-ranking officials to the funeral; many African and Latin American states sent delegations led by presidents or prime ministers.[21]

He succeeded in representing for Cubans the pride of rejecting external domination."[202] It added that "France, which condemned human rights abuses in Cuba, had equally challenged the US embargo on Cuba, and France was glad to see the two countries re-establish dialogue and open ties between themselves."[203]

    -   French Communist Party leader Pierre Laurent said that Castro had "liberated his people in 1959, at a time when the island was in some ways the brothel and the casino of rich Americans. Then he faced American imperialism… He was one of the leaders of the movement of human emancipation in the 20th century. The revolution he led took place at the time of decolonisation and was part of this movement to restore the sovereignty of peoples. That is what will remain in history."[204]

-   – After a few days, Steffen Seibert, spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel, issued a statement that described Castro as "a historic figure," but also accused him of having placed Cuba and its people "under a system of political repression for decades."

He recalled to _BBC Radio 4_' _Today_ of having met Castro on a trade mission: "He proposed a toast to Tony Blair and the third way, I proposed a toast to peace and socialism." Former cabinet minister and leader of the House of Commons Peter Hain said: "Although responsible for indefensible human rights and free speech abuses, Castro created a society of unparalleled access to free health, education and equal opportunity despite an economically throttling U.S.A. siege. His troops inflicted the first defeat on South Africa’s troops in Angola in 1988, a vital turning point in the struggle against apartheid." Former London Mayor Ken Livingstone called Castro an "absolute giant of the 20th century." He also told _Today_: "I'm sure they will, over time, move towards something like a traditional west European democracy. It could have happened a lot earlier if you hadn't had, the entire time, a blockade by America, attempts to overthrow the regime, eight assassination attempts authorised by American presidents." He further commented that "even if Trump goes a little bit bonkers.... Of course Fidel did things that were wrong.... Initially he wasn't very good on lesbian and gay rights, but the key things that mattered was that people had a good education, good healthcare and wealth was evenly distributed. He was not living as a billionaire laundering money off into a Panamanian bank account or anything like that, he was good for the people."[257]

Oceania

Speaking instead for the government, frontbench Senator Mathias Cormann described Fidel Castro as a "significant but controversial figure."

-   – Prime Minister John Key issued no formal statement, but responded informally to media queries by saying: "There's no question he repressed a lot of people and was a very polarising figure, and you can see those people that have been exiles living in Miami fundamentally rejoicing the fact that the guy has passed away."[259]

-   – Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, who had completed a state visit to Cuba just hours before Fidel Castro's death, said: "Regardless of the politics of the time, such as the Cold War in relation to Cuba, […] when a warrior passes it is time to pay homage to the person who stood by their convictions. The legacy that Fidel Castro leaves for the world is far-reaching. Outside the politics, Fidel Castro pioneered the development of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services in his country and these are being extended around the world. On behalf of the Government and the people of Papua New Guinea, I extend our sincere condolences to the Castro family for your loss, the passing of a great man of conviction."[260]

-   – Former Prime Minister Barak Sope recalled Cuba's support for Vanuatu's independence in the late 1970s and remarked: "[W]ithout Cuba and President Fidel Castro, it may have taken longer or never for this country to become an Independent State […] Today, I am sad to say that Vanuatu has lost its first political pillar of our political freedom, the late President Fidel Castro. Personally, and of course the country has lost a man that stood up for the right of the political freedom of our nation and people in international forum and the United Nations. We truly miss him.".[261]

Others

During the early hours of 26 November, the Cuban-American diaspora in Little Havana, Miami,[262] as well as in Hialeah, Florida, also had celebrations amongst the thousands of exiles.[263] In San Francisco, California, the diasporic reaction was more mixed.[264] Cuban-American celebrities commented on Castro's death, including: Jose Canseco, who wrote he "[c]an't say I feel anything for his death. There is a reason many defected to USA;"[265] and Gloria Estefan, who stated that the event marks "the symbolic death of the destructive ideologies that he espoused that, I believe, is filling the Cuban exile community with renewed hope and a relief that has been long in coming."[266] Castro's death became public too late for eastern U.S. newspapers' print editions, but CNN covered Raúl Castro's announcement as breaking news. The _Herald_ posted online its long-ready obituary, written in 2001.

Nobel Peace Prize laureate Adolfo Pérez Esquivel said: "From the roots of Our America Fidel left for eternity. Liberator, apostle, humanist, friend…"[267] His fellow Nobel laureate Rigoberta Menchú said: "Our revolution is humanist because it humanises man."[268] Former Argentine footballer Diego Maradona stated that Castro was a "great" man and that, while he was away for the 2016 Davis Cup in Croatia: "[t]hey called me from Buenos Aires and it was a shock. I'm terribly sad as he was like a second father."[269]

Minoru Hataguchi, who led Castro through the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum as its director, said Castro sympathised with the ordeal of _hibakusha_. He quoted Castro as having said: "Che Guevara told me to go to Hiroshima. I’m glad I came." He added that Castro "sympathised with the people of Hiroshima and his death is unfortunate." He further noted that Castro's questions "showed his character, that he was trying to understand the agonies of the _hibakusha_." Masakazu Masukawa, another _hibakusha_ who had met Castro during a visit to Cuba in 2012 recalled that Castro "was a person of influence. If he had called on the world to abandon nuclear weapons early on, momentum might have grown bigger."[270]

Chairman of the Human Rights Foundation Garry Kasparov wrote: "Fidel Castro was one of the 20th century's many monsters. We should lament only that he had so long to inflict misery on Cuba and beyond." Amnesty International's Americas Director Erika Guevara-Rosas issued a statement that described Castro as a "progressive but deeply flawed leader." It cited: "Access to public services such as health and education for Cubans were substantially improved by the Cuban revolution and for this, his leadership must be applauded. However, despite these achievements in areas of social policy, Fidel Castro’s 49-year reign was characterised by a ruthless suppression of freedom of expression... Fidel Castro’s legacy is a tale of two worlds. The question now is what human rights will look like in a future Cuba. The lives of many depend on it."[271]
