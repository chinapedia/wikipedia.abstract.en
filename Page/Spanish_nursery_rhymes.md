Nursery rhymes () in the Spanish language have been passed down by oral tradition. They may be classified according to their amusing, educative or soothing qualities.


History and context

Nursery rhymes are short songs written for small children. The lyrics are usually simple and repetitive for easy comprehension and memorization. Although they are meant to be lighthearted and fun, they also function as an introduction to music and certain basic concepts learned through repetition and song.

Traditionally, nursery rhymes are taught through oral tradition where knowledge, stories, and songs are learned through generational repetition as part of familial or popular culture. In more recent decades, specialized artists have worked within the infant market.

Nursery rhymes are activities through which children can learn and play with different melodies. They also introduce children to popular themes that help with early socialization.[1]

Many Latin American nursery rhymes are based in the context of the farm or rural life. After the Spanish conquest of the continent, much of the oral tradition derived from religious and superstitious traditions with the goal of introducing children to formative social concepts.


Classification by function

One possible method of nursery rhyme classification is that of function. Although it is possible that one song may fall under more than one category, each has a different goal or purpose:

-   Play songs or _De Juego_
-   Lullabies or _Nanas/Canciones de cuna_
-   Tongue-twisters or _De habilidad_
-   Teaching songs or _Didácticas_

Examples

_Los Pollitos Dicen_ ("Little Chickens") is a classic Spanish Nursery Rhyme _De juego_, and also falls under the _Nana_ or _Cancion de cuna_ category. Many spanish speaking countries lay claim to this song such as Ecuador and Spain, but its origins are unclear. Its popularity is similar to that of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" in English.

<poem lang="es" style="float:left;margin-left: 2em;> ''Los pollitos dicen _pío, pío, pío_

_cuando tienen hambre_ _cuando tienen frio._

_La gallina busca el maiz_ _y el trigo_

_les da la comida y les_ _presta abrigo._

_Bajo de sus alas,_ _acurrucaditos_

_duermen los pollitos hasta_ _el otro día!_'' Little chickies squeal, pio pio pio,

When they are so cold, and when they want a meal.

Mama goes and gets them corn from the field,

serves them each their food, and warms them head to heel.

Chickies sleep so yummy, snuggled up with mommy,

And that’s just where they’ll stay until another day.[2]
