WILLIAM HARCUS (c. 1823 – 10 August 1876) was a Congregationalist minister in England and South Australia, where he later turned journalist and editor.


History

Harcus was born in Newcastle upon Tyne and trained for the Congregational ministry at Cotton End. He served as minister of religion in Loughborough, Doncaster, and Toxteth Park (Liverpool). While in England he made literary contribution to several journals, notably a series "Lives of the Apostles" for the _Christian Witness_.[1]

In 1860 he emigrated with his wife and children to South Australia, where he was appointed minister of the Clayton Congregational Church in a part of Kensington now known as Beulah Park. In 1862 he started on a journalistic career as a leader writer for the South Australian Register, but continued to serve as pastor at Clayton Church until 1865, when the post was filled by the Rev. Eliezer Griffiths (1827–1920). In 1872, when Griffiths left for England, Harcus served in an honorary capacity for some six months until a permanent replacement, Thomas Hope (1846–1916), was appointed.

In 1867 he left the _Register_ for its competitor, _The Advertiser_, where on the death of J. H. Barrow, he took over the position of Editor.[2] Aside from serious journalism, he was a capable poet and humorous writer, noted for his "Laconic Leader" columns in _The Advertiser_.[3]

Harcus was made a Justice of the Peace in 1871, and was frequently called on to act on the Bench or as Coroner.[4]

He was editor of, and contributor to the _Handbook of South Australia_[5] and _South Australia, its History, Resources and Productions_.[6] He died in August 1876 after a six days of intense suffering. His wife Eliza founded Dryburgh House School at "Palm House" in Hackney in 1876 following his death.
