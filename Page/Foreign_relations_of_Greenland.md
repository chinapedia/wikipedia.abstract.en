Being part of the Kingdom of Denmark, the FOREIGN RELATIONS OF GREENLAND are handled in cooperation with the Danish government and Government of Greenland.

Unlike Denmark, Greenland is no longer part of the European Union, the country changed its status to an OCT, a dependent territory that have a special relationship with a member state of the EU. However, Greenland remains a full member of the Council of Europe and NATO.


General aspects of diplomatic relations

With the Kingdom of Denmark having the responsibility for Greenland's international affairs, other countries do not have direct diplomatic representation in Greenland—their embassies or consulates in Denmark are responsible for their relations with Greenland and their citizens in Greenland. Greenland is represented internationally by the embassies and consulates of Denmark, although Greenland does directly participate in some Nordic organisations like the West Nordic Council and the Overseas Countries and Territories Association that provide membership for dependent territories.


Diplomatic representations

Greenland has several representative offices in several countries.

-   -   Brussels (Representative Office)

-   -   Copenhagen (Representative Office)

-   -   Reykjavík (Representative Office)[1][2]

-   -   Washington, D.C. (Representative Office)[3]

Another office is planned for Beijing.[4]
