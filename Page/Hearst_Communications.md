HEARST COMMUNICATIONS, often referred to simply as HEARST, is an American mass media and business information conglomerate based in New York City.[1]

Hearst owns newspapers, magazines, television channels, and television stations, including the _San Francisco Chronicle_, the _Houston Chronicle_, _Cosmopolitan_ and _Esquire_. It owns 50% of the A&E Networks cable network group and 20% of the sports cable network group ESPN, both in partnership with The Walt Disney Company.[2]

While Hearst is perhaps better known for the above media holdings, the company also has significant businesses in the business information section, where it owns companies including Fitch Ratings, First Databank, and others.[3]

Hearst Communications is based in the Hearst Tower in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The company was founded by William Randolph Hearst as an owner of newspapers, and the Hearst family remains involved in its ownership and management.


History

The formative years

In 1880, George Hearst, mining entrepreneur and U.S. senator, entered the publishing business by acquiring the _San Francisco Daily Examiner._[4] In 1887, he turned the _Examiner_ over to his son, William Randolph Hearst, who that year officially founded the Hearst Corp. W. R. Hearst later went on to purchase or launch several more newspapers in multiple cities (including the _New York Journal_ in 1895)[5] and to found the _Los Angeles Examiner_ in 1903.[6] W. R. Hearst found early success, growing readership for the _Examiner_ from 15,000 in 1887 to over 20 million.[7]

Hearst's magazine division began in 1903, with W. R. Hearst's creation of _Motor_ magazine. He later acquired several other publications, including _Cosmopolitan_ in 1905, and _Good Housekeeping_ in 1911.[8][9] W. R. Hearst entered the book publishing business in 1913 with the formation of Hearst's International Library.[10] W. R. Hearst began producing film features in the mid-1910s, creating one of the earliest animation studios: the International Film Service, turning characters from Hearst newspaper strips into film characters.[11] After purchasing the _Atlanta Georgian_ in 1912,[12] the _San Francisco Call_ and the _San Francisco Post_ in 1913, Hearst acquired the _Boston Advertiser_ and the _Washington Times_ (unrelated to the present-day paper) in 1917. He later purchased the _Chicago Herald_ in 1918 (resulting in the _Herald-Examiner_).[13] In 1919, Hearst's book publishing division was renamed Cosmopolitan Book.[14]

The peak era

HEARST2.JPG In the 1920s and 1930s, Hearst owned the biggest media conglomerate in the world, which included a number of magazines and newspapers in major cities. Hearst also began acquiring radio stations to complement his papers.[15] Hearst saw financial challenges in the early 1920s, during which time he was subsidizing funds from his corporation to fund the construction of Hearst Castle in San Simeon and movie production at Cosmopolitan Productions. This eventually lead to the merger of the magazine _Hearst International_ with _Cosmopolitan_ in 1925.[16]

Despite some financial troubles, Hearst began extending its reach in 1921, purchasing the _Detroit Times_, _The Boston Record_ and the _Seattle Post-Intelligencer._[17] Hearst then added the _Los Angeles Herald_ and _Washington Herald,_ as well as the _Oakland Post-Enquirer_, the _Syracuse Telegram_ and the _Rochester Journal_ in 1922. He continued his buying spree into the mid-1920s, purchasing the _Baltimore News_ (1923), the _San Antonio Light_ (1924), the _Albany Times Union_ (1924),[18] and _The Milwaukee Sentinel_ (1924). In 1924, Hearst entered the tabloid market in New York City with _The New York Mirror_, meant to compete with the _New York Daily News_.[19]

In addition to print and radio, Hearst established Cosmopolitan Pictures in the early 1920s, distributing his films under the newly created Metro Goldwyn Mayer.[20] In 1929, Hearst and MGM created the Hearst Metrotone newsreels.[21]

Retrenching after the Great Depression

The Great Depression had a negative impact on Hearst and his publications. Cosmopolitan Book was sold to Farrar & Rinehart in 1931.[22] After two years of leasing them to her, Hearst had to sell the _Washington Times_ and _Herald_ to Eleanor "Cissy" Patterson (of the McCormick-Patterson family that owned the _Chicago Tribune_) in 1939 who merged them to form the _Washington Times-Herald_. That year he also bought the _Milwaukee Sentinel_ from Paul Block (who bought it from the Pfisters in 1929), absorbing his afternoon _Wisconsin News_ into the morning publication. Also in 1939, he sold the _Atlanta Georgian_ to Cox Newspapers, which merged it with the _Atlanta Journal_.

Hearst, with his chain now owned by his creditors after a 1937 liquidation[23], also had to merge some of his morning papers into his afternoon papers. In Chicago, he combined the morning _Herald-Examiner_ and the afternoon _American_ into the _Herald-American_ in 1939. This followed the 1937 combination of the New York _Evening Journal_ and the morning _American_ into the _New York Journal-American_, the sale of the _Omaha Daily Bee_ to the _World-Herald_. Abandoning the morning market was harmful in the long run for Hearst's media holdings as most of his remaining newspapers became afternoon papers. Newspapers in Rochester, Syracuse and Fort Worth were sold or closed.

Afternoon papers were a profitable business in pre-television days, often outselling their morning counterparts featuring stock market information in early editions, while later editions were heavy on sporting news with results of baseball games and horse races. Afternoon papers also benefited from continuous reports from the battlefront during World War II. After the war, however, both television news and suburbs experienced an explosive growth; thus, evening papers were more affected than those published in the morning, whose circulation remained stable while their afternoon counterparts' sales plummeted. Another major blow was the fact that beginning in the 1950s, football and baseball games were being played later in the afternoon and now stretched through early in the evening, preventing afternoon papers from publishing all the results.

In 1947, Hearst produced an early television newscast for the DuMont Television Network: _I.N.S. Telenews_, and in 1948 he became the owner of one of the first television stations in the country, WBAL-TV in Baltimore.

The earnings of Hearst's three morning papers, the _San Francisco Examiner_, the _Los Angeles Examiner_, and _The Milwaukee Sentinel_, supported the company's money-losing afternoon publications such as the _Los Angeles Herald-Express_, the _New York Journal-American_, and the _Chicago American_. The company sold the latter paper in 1956 to the _Chicago Tribune_{{'}}s owners, who changed it to the tabloid-size _Chicago Today_ in 1969 and ceased publication in 1974). In 1960, Hearst also sold the _Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph_ to the _Pittsburgh Post-Gazette_ and the _Detroit Times_ to _The Detroit News_. After a lengthy strike it sold the _Milwaukee Sentinel_ to the afternoon _Milwaukee Journal_ in 1962. The same year Hearst's Los Angeles papers – the morning _Examiner_ and the afternoon _Herald-Express_ – merged to become the evening _Los Angeles Herald-Examiner_. The 1962-63 New York City newspaper strike left the city with no papers for over three months, with the _Journal-American_ one of the earliest strike targets of the Typographical Union. The _Boston Record_ and the _Evening American_ merged in 1961 as the _Record-American_ and in 1964, the _Baltimore News-Post_ became the _Baltimore News-American_.

In 1953 Hearst Magazines bought _Sports Afield_ magazine, which it published until 1999 when it sold the journal to Robert E. Petersen. In 1958, Hearst's International News Service merged with E.W. Scripps' United Press, forming United Press International as a response to the growth of the Associated Press and Reuters. The following year Scripps-Howard's _San Francisco News_ merged with Hearst's afternoon _San Francisco Call-Bulletin_. Also in 1959, Hearst acquired the paperback book publisher Avon Books.[24]

In 1965, the Hearst Corporation began pursuing Joint Operating Agreements (JOA's). It reached the first agreement with the DeYoung family, proprietors of the afternoon _San Francisco Chronicle_, which began to produce a joint Sunday edition with the _Examiner_. In turn, the _Examiner_ became an evening publication, absorbing the _News-Call-Bulletin_. The following year, the _Journal-American_ reached another JOA with another two landmark New York City papers: the _Herald-Tribune_ and Scripps-Howard's _World-Telegram and Sun_ to form the _New York World Journal Tribune_ (recalling the names of the city's mid-market dailies), which collapsed after only a few months.

The 1962 merger of the _Herald-Express_ and _Examiner_ in Los Angeles led to the termination of many journalists who began to stage a 10-year strike in 1967. The effects of the strike accelerated the pace of the company's demise, with the _Herald Examiner_ ceasing publication November 2, 1989.[25]

Newspaper shifts

Hearst moved into hardcover publishing by acquiring Arbor House in 1978 and William Morrow and Company in 1981.[26][27]

In 1982, the company sold the _Boston Herald American_ —the result of the 1972 merger of Hearst's _Record-American & Advertiser_ with the _Herald-Traveler_— to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which promptly renamed the paper as _The Boston Herald_, competing to this day with the _Boston Globe_.

In 1986, Hearst bought the _Houston Chronicle_ and that same year closed the 213-year-old _Baltimore News-American_ after a failed attempt to reach a JOA with A.S. Abell Company, the family who published _The Baltimore Sun_ since its founding in 1837. Abell sold the paper several days later to the Times-Mirror syndicate of the Chandlers' _Los Angeles Times_, also competitor to the evening _Los Angeles Herald-Examiner_, which folded in 1989.

In 1993, Hearst closed the _San Antonio Light_ after it purchased the rival _San Antonio Express-News_ from Murdoch.

On November 8, 1990, Hearst Corporation acquired the remaining 20% stake of ESPN, Inc. from RJR Nabisco for a price estimated between $165 million and $175 million.[28] The other 80% has been owned by The Walt Disney Company since 1996. Over the last 25 years, the ESPN investment is said to have accounted for at least 50% of total Hearst Corp profits and is worth at least $13 billion.[29]

In 1999, Hearst sold its Avon and Morrow book publishing activities to HarperCollins.[30]

In 2000, the Hearst Corp. pulled another "switcheroo" by selling its flagship and "Monarch of the Dailies", the afternoon _San Francisco Examiner_, and acquiring the long-time competing, but now larger morning paper, _San Francisco Chronicle_ from the Charles de Young family. The _San Francisco Examiner_ is now published as a daily freesheet.

In December 2003, Marvel Entertainment acquired _Cover Concepts_ from Hearst, to extend Marvel's demographic reach among public school children.[31]

In 2009, A&E Networks acquired Lifetime Entertainment Services, with Hearst ownership increasing to 42%.[32][33]

In 2009, the _Seattle Post-Intelligencer_ switched to a digital-only format, leaving the _Albany Times-Union_ as the only remaining Hearst paper from the interwar period still owned by the company. In 2010, Hearst acquired digital marketing agency iCrossing.[34]

In 2011, Hearst absorbed more than 100 magazine titles from the Lagardere group for more than $700 million and became a challenger of Time Inc ahead of Condé Nast. In December 2012, Hearst Corporation partnered again with NBCUniversal to launch Esquire Network.

On February 20, 2014, Hearst Magazines International appointed Gary Ellis to the new position, Chief Digital Officer.[35] That December, DreamWorks Animation sold a 25% stake in AwesomenessTV for $81.25 million to Hearst.[36]

In January 2017, Hearst announced that it had acquired a majority stake in Litton Entertainment. Its CEO, Dave Morgan, was a former employee of Hearst.[37][38]

On January 23, 2017, Hearst announced that it had acquired the business operations of The Pioneer Group from fourth-generation family owners Jack and John Batdorff. The Pioneer Group was a Michigan-based communications network that circulates print and digital news to local communities across the state. In addition to daily newspapers, _The Pioneer_ and _Manistee News Advocate_, Pioneer published three weekly papers and four local shopper publications, and operated a digital marketing services business.[39] The acquisition brought Hearst Newspapers to publishing 19 daily and 61 weekly papers.

Other 2017 acquisitions include the _New Haven Register_ and associated papers from Digital First Media,[40][41] and the Alton, Illinois, _Telegraph_ and Jacksonville, Illinois, _Journal-Courier_ from Civitas Media.[42][43]

In October 2017, Hearst announced it would acquire the magazine and book businesses of Rodale, with some sources reporting the purchase price as about $225 million. The transaction was expected to close in January following government approvals.[44][45]

Trustees of William Randolph Hearst's will

Under William Randolph Hearst's will, a common board of thirteen trustees (its composition fixed at five family members and eight outsiders) administers the Hearst Foundation, the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, and the trust that owns (and selects the 24-member board of) the Hearst Corporation (immediate parent of Hearst Communications which shares the same officers). The foundations shared ownership until tax law changed to prevent this.[61][62]

In 2009, it was estimated to be the largest private company managed by trustees in this way.[63] As of 2017, the trustees are:[64]

Family members

-   Ana Balson, granddaughter of fifth son, David Whitmire Hearst Sr.
-   Lisa Hearst Hagerman, granddaughter of third son, John Randolph Hearst Sr.
-   George Randolph Hearst III, grandson of Hearst's eldest son, George Randolph Hearst Sr., and publisher of the _Albany Times Union_
-   William Randolph Hearst III, son of second son, William Randolph Hearst Jr., and chairman of the board of the corporation
-   Virginia Hearst Randt, daughter of late former chairman and fourth son, Randolph Apperson Hearst

Non-family members

-   James M. Asher, chief legal and development officer of the corporation
-   David J. Barrett, former chief executive officer of Hearst Television, Inc.
-   Frank A. Bennack Jr., former chief executive officer and executive vice chairman of the corporation
-   John G. Conomikes, former executive of the corporation
-   Gilbert C. Maurer, former chief operating officer of the corporation and former president of Hearst Magazines
-   Mark F. Miller, former executive vice president of Hearst Magazines
-   Mitchell Scherzer, senior vice president and chief financial officer of the corporation
-   Steven R. Swartz, president and chief executive officer of the corporation

The trust dissolves when all family members alive at the time of Hearst's death in August 1951 have died.
