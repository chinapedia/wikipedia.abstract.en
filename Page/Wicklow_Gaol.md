WICKLOW GAOL is a former prison, now a museum, located in the town of Wicklow, County Wicklow, Ireland.[1]


History

Prison

There has been a prison on the site since the late eighteenth century. Prisoners were held at Wicklow Gaol during the 1798 Rebellion and the Irish Potato Famine, as well as many held there prior to penal transportation.[2]

The prison was extended in 1822 to a design by William Vitruvius Morrison, and further extended 1842-3.

The prison was closed down by 1900 but reopened to hold republican prisoners during the Irish War of Independence and Irish Civil War; the last prisoners left in 1924.

Museum

In 1995 renovations began, and it reopened as a museum in 1998, claiming to be one of the world's most haunted buildings, due to the long history of suffering associated with it. It featured on a 2009 episode of _Ghost Hunters International_.[3][4]
