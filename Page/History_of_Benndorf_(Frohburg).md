In 1485 _Johann_ sold by Bresen on Benndorf a piece of wood to _Heinrich von Einsiedel_ in Gnandstein.[4]
Around the year 1500, the Benndorf church was built.[5]


16th century

RittergutBenndorfLuftbild2011.jpg In Visitation protocol from 1533 _Caspar von Mergenthal_ and _Rudolf von Bunaw_ be named as owner Benndorf. _Caspar von Minkwitz_ met us on 1535 Benndorf. 1540 sold this Frohburg and Benndorf "sessig on Kossern" _Nickel of Techwitz_. This is on October 30, 1542 by the Ernestine Electors Johann Friedrich, in turn, by the bailiff of Altenburg, admonished to comply with its pecuniary obligations to the pastor of Benndorf.[6]

Already in 1549 sold _Nickel of Techwitz_ the manors Frohburg and Benndorf because overindebted, to _Melchior von Kreutzen_. The purchase contract is the Albertine Elector Moritz signed with. _Melchior von Kreutzen_ died "to Frohburg at his castle by Ursula, which was October 24, 1555 at 9:00 am," so now states that at the western porch of Frohburger Church brazen grave slab with Kreutzer almost life-size figure. His son and successor _Bernhard von Kreutzen_ did not come out of the financial difficulties, so that it in 1600 "on the Schneeberg" retired and his possessions to his cousin _Melchior von Kreutzen_ from the Prussian line left, of them, however, already in 1602 ceded to his son _Christoph von Kreutzen_. But this passed away much too early. Under his skillful hand the two goods could also have financially flourish again. With high honors, in the presence of Duke Johann Georg he was buried on 2 October 1609. His widow managed from 1609, goods with _Wolf von Kreutzen_ on Ballstädt and _Henry Friesen_ on Rötha for her only son _Melchior_, who receives but transferred deeply in debt these goods. Perhaps to the financial worries sake he enlists and is probably also the war like, because on January 23, 1630 enters his widow _Sabine_ (from the house of Priessnitz Einsiedel) Frohburg to creditors of her husband from , Either under this widow _Sabine von Kreutzen_ or still alive her husband _Melchior von Kreutzen_ Benndorf must have been sold. Thus, the separation of freight and Benndorf Frohburg has occurred.[7]


17th century

Orangerie_vom_Rittergut_Benndorf_P0465453u2_klein_Orangerie.jpg 1625 _Georg Berger_ is mentioned as the owner of the stately "Erbschenke" to Benndorf. The widow of _Christoph von Kreutzen_ sold Frohburg to creditors of her husband. This led to a separation of goods Benndorf and Frohburg.

At the beginning of the 17th century Benndorf is in possession of the lords of _Ende_, of which _Wolf_ was said to be a good farmer and of _Ende_ (from the album of the manors of Saxony).

Already on 20 January 1669 writes there on page 52 _Eberhard_ sleep. He called on the same side "of the right doctor and practiko and hereditary lord on Benndorf". As is apparent from the documents listed above, many memories and additions made themselves necessary at this time because of the forced labors and taxes. The vassals wanted to appear to provide relief, which is to be understood as they were depleted by the not distant past 30-year war. Because of the duties led the farmers with the landowners a process they are already lost in 1675 in front of the Supreme Court to Leipzig. Your revision was on June 14, 1676 again discarded. You turned to the Court of Appeal of the Elector of Saxony in Magdeburg. But eventually it came to a comparison between the two parties, since a change of ownership had occurred in Manor Benndorf. In 1676 two brothers, namely the "Princely Saxon court and Justitionsrat to Altenburg" _Johann Caspar Hendrich_ and the "Princely Saxon Landrentmeister to Coburg" _Johann Friedrich Hendrich_ Men on Benndorf are. They are led in the above mentioned document on page 55 left. The two brothers had, in turn, to litigate against the widow of the late tensioner _George_ foreman who refused to pay the "Hauptlehnwahr" (5% royalty of the basic value in case of death) because it this good with her daughter that a certain _Georg Eidner_ had married, together wanted to continue farming. The process has also been performed in front of the King's Bench in Leipzig and ended with an amicable settlement (pp 56 and 57 of the official document). After the date, which carries the official document, the two brothers must have still been the owner of the manor on June 12, 1680.
