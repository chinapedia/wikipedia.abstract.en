An ESBAT is a coven meeting at a time other than one of the Sabbats[1] within Wicca and other Wiccan-influenced forms of contemporary Paganism. Janet and Stewart Farrar describe esbats as an opportunity for a "love feast, healing work, psychic training and all."[2]


Etymology

The term _esbat_ is derived from Old French _s'esbattre_ (Modern French _Ã©bat_), meaning _to frolic and amuse oneself_, _diversion_.[3][4] It was a borrowing by 20th century anthropologist Margaret Murray's use of French witch trial sources on supposed Witches' Sabbaths in her attempts to "reconstruct" a _Witch Cult in Western Europe_.


Observance

An esbat is commonly understood to be a ritual observance on the night of a full moon.[5] However, the late high priestess Doreen Valiente distinguished between "full moon Esbat[s]" and other esbatic occasions.[6]

The term _esbat_ in this sense was described by Margaret Murray.[7][8]
