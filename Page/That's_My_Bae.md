THAT'S MY BAE (also known as EB BAES, TMB or TROPS) is a Filipino dance group formed in the _That's My Bae: "Twerk It" Dance Contest_ segment of the noontime variety show _Eat Bulaga!_,[1] and officially debutted on August 24, 2015. The group is composed of six members: Kim Last, Kenneth Medrano, Joel Palencia, Tommy Peñaflor, Jon Timmons and Miggy Tolentino.

Career

2015: _That's My Bae: "Twerk It" Dance Contest_ and line-up changes

On July 6, 2015, _Eat Bulaga!_ launched a new segment called _That's My Bae: "Twerk It" Dance Contest_ hosted by Sam Y.G. and Alden Richards. It is a dance contest for male contestants who are referred to as "baes," a slang word for "baby/babe as a term of endearment. The contestants dance to the 2014 hit single "Twerk It Like Miley" by Brandon Beal to showcase their talent and looks. The daily winners underwent a series of elimination rounds until only seven contestants remained in the grand finals of the competition. The seven grand finalists were Gab Bayan, Kim Last, Kenneth Medrano, Joel Palencia, Tommy Peñaflor, Jon Timmons, and Miggy Tolentino.

In August 2015, Kenneth Medrano was named as the grand winner of the competition. Subsequently, Medrano and the six other grand finalists were regularly seen on _Eat Bulaga!_ as a dance group now known as That's My Bae. The name of their group was taken directly from the title of the segment from which they were discovered. To further give them exposure, That's My Bae was given their own segment entitled _ATM with the Baes_. At this point, they were considered as a mainstay dance group in _Eat Bulaga!_.

The group was still composed of seven members until the quiet departure of Gab Bayan in December 2015. Bayan left the group in order to return to Far Eastern University and to focus on his studies.[2] Without any formal announcement, JV Suzara, a contestant in _That's My Bae: "Twerk It" Dance Contest_ who finished as a semi-finalist, was added to the group as a replacement.

2016–present: JV's departure, Acting ventures, concert, and first anniversary

After the end of _ATM with the Baes_, That's My Bae appeared in several other segments of _Eat Bulaga!_, including _Hotline Bae_, _Dancing in Tandem_, and _Kalyeserye_. Kenneth Medrano was even given a minor role as Peping during the flashback retelling of Nidora and Anselmo's love story in _Kalyeserye_. The members of That's My Bae were also included in AlDub's wedding entourage for _Kalyeserye_.

In February 2016, JV Suzara decided to leave the group after his short stint as a member. Suzara then formed his own group called Bae Alert, an all-male dance group composed of other semi-finalists from the _That's My Bae: "Twerk It" Dance Contest_ segment of _Eat Bulaga!_. Meanwhile, That's My Bae continued on with only six members.

In March 2016, the members of the group were included in the cast of the "Walang Kapalit" episode of the annual _Eat Bulaga! Lenten Special_ presentation. Medrano was given a main role, while the other members made cameo appearances during the episode. Although Medrano had a supporting role in _Buena Familia_, his participation in the Lenten special was his first portrayal as a lead role.[3] In June 2016, Medrano starred in the morning drama series _Calle Siete_, and was paired with showbiz newcomer Taki Saito. Soon, Saito was regularly performing with That's My Bae on _Eat Bulaga!_.[4] Meanwhile, Kim Last was added as a regular cast member of the Sunday comedy-variety show _Sunday PinaSaya_.

On October 8, 2016 was declared by _Eat Bulaga!_ as "Bae Day" in order to celebrate the anniversary of the formation of That's My Bae. On that day, _Eat Bulaga!_ also announced that the group will be given their own television show entitled _Trops_ with Taki Saito. This is the debut television series of the group. They will also be accompanied by showbiz newcomer, Toni Aquino, daughter of _Eat Bulaga!_ host Ruby Rodriguez. _Trops_ is That's My Bae's first acting career as a group. The show premiered on October 24, 2016. It is produced by TAPE, Inc. and broadcast on GMA Network.[5]

On December 3, 2016, _Eat Bulaga!_ announced that the group with Taki Saito will be having its first ever concert on December 16, 2016 in SM City North EDSA Sky Dome.[6] However, due to an undeclared reason, the concert was cancelled. The concert was rescheduled on March 24, 2017 and is titled _#TropsGoals: Party with the Baes_.
