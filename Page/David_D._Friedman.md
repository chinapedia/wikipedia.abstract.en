DAVID DIRECTOR FRIEDMAN (born February 12, 1945) is an American economist, physicist, legal scholar, and libertarian theorist. He is known for his textbook writings on microeconomics and the libertarian theory of anarcho-capitalism, which is the subject of his most popular book, _The Machinery of Freedom_.[1] Besides _The Machinery of Freedom_, he has authored several other books and articles, including _Price Theory: An Intermediate Text_ (1986), _Law's Order: What Economics Has to Do with Law and Why It Matters_ (2000), _Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life_ (1996), and _Future Imperfect_ (2008).[2]


Life and work

David Friedman is the son of economists Rose and Milton Friedman. He graduated _magna cum laude_ from Harvard University in 1965, with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and physics.[3] He later earned a master's (1967) and a Ph.D. (1971) in theoretical physics from the University of Chicago.[4] Despite his later career, he never took a class for credit in either economics or law.[5] He is currently a professor of law at Santa Clara University,[6] and a contributing editor for _Liberty_ magazine. He is an atheist.[7] His son, Patri Friedman, has also written about libertarian theory and market anarchism, particularly seasteading.

_The Machinery of Freedom_

In his book _The Machinery of Freedom_ (1973), Friedman sketched a form of anarcho-capitalism where all goods and services including law itself can be produced by the free market. Friedman advocates an incrementalist approach to achieve anarcho-capitalism by gradual privatization of areas that government is involved in, ultimately privatizing the law itself. In the book, he states his opposition to violent anarcho-capitalist revolution.[8]

He advocates a consequentialist version of anarcho-capitalism, arguing for anarchism on a cost-benefit analysis of state versus no state.[9] It is contrasted with the natural-rights approach as propounded most notably by economist and libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard.


Non-academic interests

Friedman is a longtime member of the Society for Creative Anachronism, where he is known as _Duke Cariadoc of the Bow_. He is known throughout the worldwide society for his articles on the philosophy of recreationism and practical historical recreations, especially those relating to the medieval Middle East.[10] His work is compiled in the popular _Cariadoc's Miscellany_.[11] He is sometimes credited with founding the largest and longest-running SCA event, the Pennsic War; as king of the Middle Kingdom he challenged the East Kingdom, and later as king of the East accepted the challenge...and lost.[12]

He is a long-time science fiction fan, and has written two fantasy novels, _Harald_ (Baen Books, 2006) and _Salamander_ (2011).

He has spoken in favor of a non-interventionist foreign policy.[13]
