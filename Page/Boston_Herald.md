The _BOSTON HERALD_ is an American daily newspaper whose primary market is Boston, Massachusetts and its surrounding area. It was founded in 1846 and is one of the oldest daily newspapers in the United States. It has been awarded eight Pulitzer Prizes in its history, including four for editorial writing and three for photography before it was converted to tabloid format in 1981. The _Herald_ was named one of the "10 Newspapers That 'Do It Right'{{-"}} in 2012 by _Editor & Publisher_.[1]

In December 2017, the _Herald_ filed for bankruptcy. On February 14, 2018, Digital First Media successfully bid $11.9 million to purchase the company in a bankruptcy auction;[2] the acquisition was completed on March 19, 2018.[3] As of August 2018, the paper employs approximately 110 total employees now, compared to about 225 before the sale.[4]


History

The _Herald_{{'s}} history can be traced back through two lineages, the _Daily Advertiser_ and the old _Boston Herald_, and two media moguls, William Randolph Hearst and Rupert Murdoch.

The original _Boston Herald_

The original _Boston Herald_ was founded in 1846 by a group of Boston printers jointly under the name of John A. French & Company. The paper was published as a single two-sided sheet, selling for one cent. Its first editor, William O. Eaton, just 22 years old, said "The _Herald_ will be independent in politics and religion; liberal, industrious, enterprising, critically concerned with literacy and dramatic matters, and diligent in its mission to report and analyze the news, local and global."

In 1847, the _Boston Herald_ absorbed the Boston _American Eagle_ and the Boston _Daily Times_.[5]

_The Boston Herald and Boston Journal_

In October 1917, John H. Higgins, the publisher and treasurer of the Boston Herald[6] bought out its next door neighbor _The Boston Journal_ and created _The Boston Herald and Boston Journal_[7]

_The American Traveler_

Even earlier than the _Herald_, the weekly _American Traveler_ was founded in 1825 as a bulletin for stagecoach listings.[8]

The _Boston Evening Traveller_

The _Boston Evening Traveler_ was founded in 1845. The '' Boston Evening Traveler'' was the successor to the weekly _American Traveler_ and the semi-weekly _Boston Traveler_.[9] In 1912, the _Herald_ acquired the _Traveler_, continuing to publish both under their own names. For many years, the newspaper was controlled by many of the investors in United Shoe Machinery Co. After a newspaper strike in 1967, Herald-Traveler Corp. suspended the afternoon _Traveler_ and absorbed the evening edition into the Herald to create the _Boston Herald Traveler._

_The Boston Daily Advertiser_

Boston_Advertiser_Building.png The _Boston Daily Advertiser_ was established in 1813 in Boston by Nathan Hale. The paper grew to prominence throughout the 19th century, taking over other Boston area papers. In 1832 The Advertiser took over control of _The Boston Patriot_, and then in 1840 it took over and absorbed _The Boston Gazette_.[10] The paper was purchased by William Randolph Hearst in 1917. In 1920 the _Advertiser_ was merged with _The Boston Record_, initially the combined newspaper was called the _Boston Advertiser_ however when the combined newspaper became an illustrated tabloid in 1921 it was renamed _The Boston American_.[11] Hearst Corp. continued using the name _Advertiser_ for its Sunday paper until the early 1970s.

_The Boston Record_

On September 3, 1884, _The Boston Evening Record_ was started by the _Boston Advertiser_ as a campaign newspaper. The _Record_ was so popular that it was made a permanent publication.[12]

_The Boston American_

In 1904, William Randolph Hearst began publishing his own newspaper in Boston called _The American_. Hearst ultimately ended up purchasing the _Daily Advertiser_ in 1917. By 1938, the _Daily Advertiser_ had changed to the _Daily Record_, and _The American_ had become the _Sunday Advertiser_. A third paper owned by Hearst, called the _Afternoon Record_, which had been renamed the _Evening American_, merged in 1961 with the _Daily Record_ to form the _Record American_. The _Sunday Advertiser_ and _Record American_ would ultimately be merged in 1972 into _The Boston Herald Traveler_ a line of newspapers that stretched back to the old _Boston Herald_.

_The Boston Herald Traveler_

In 1946, Herald-Traveler Corporation acquired Boston radio station WHDH. Two years later, WHDH-FM was licensed, and on November 26, 1957, WHDH-TV made its début as an ABC affiliate on channel 5. In 1961, WHDH-TV's affiliation switched to CBS. Herald-Traveler Corp. operated for years beginning some time after under temporary authority from the Federal Communications Commission stemming from controversy over luncheon meetings the newspaper's chief executive purportedly had with John C. Doerfer, chairman of the FCC between 1957 and 1960, who served as a commissioner during the original licensing process. (Some Boston broadcast historians accuse _The Boston Globe_ of being covertly behind the proceeding as a sort of vendetta for not getting a license—The _Herald Traveler_ was Republican in sympathies, and the _Globe_ then had a firm policy of not endorsing political candidates, although Doerfer's history at the FCC also lent suspicions) The FCC ordered comparative hearings, and in 1969 a competing applicant, Boston Broadcasters, Inc., was granted a construction permit to replace WHDH-TV on channel 5. Herald-Traveler Corp. fought the decision in court—by this time, revenues from channel 5 were all but keeping the newspaper afloat—but its final appeal ran out in 1972, and on March 19 WHDH-TV was forced to surrender channel 5 to the new WCVB-TV.

_The Boston Herald Traveler and Record American_

Without a television station to subsidize the newspaper, the _Herald Traveler_ was no longer able to remain in business, and the newspaper was sold to Hearst Corporation, which published the rival all-day newspaper, the _Record American_. The two papers were merged to become an all-day paper called the _Boston Herald Traveler and Record American_ in the morning and _Record-American and Boston Herald Traveler_ in the afternoon. The first editions published under the new combined name were those of June 19, 1972. The afternoon edition was soon dropped and the unwieldy name shortened to _Boston Herald American_, with the Sunday edition called the _Sunday Herald Advertiser_. The _Herald American_ was printed in broadsheet format, and failed to target a particular readership; where the _Record American_ had been a typical city tabloid, the _Herald Traveler_ was a Republican paper.

Murdoch purchases _The Herald American_

The _Herald American_ converted to tabloid format in September 1981, but Hearst faced steep declines in circulation and advertising. The company announced it would close the _Herald American_—making Boston a one-newspaper town—on December 3, 1982. When the deadline came, Australian media baron Rupert Murdoch was negotiating to buy the paper and save it. He closed on the deal after 30 hours of talks with Hearst and newspaper unions—and five hours after Hearst had sent out notices to newsroom employees telling them they were terminated. The newspaper announced its own survival the next day with a full-page headline: "You Bet We're Alive!"[13]

The _Boston Herald_ once again

Murdoch changed the paper's name back to the _Boston Herald_. The _Herald_ continued to grow, expanding its coverage and increasing its circulation until 2001, when nearly all newspapers fell victim to declining circulations and revenue.

Independent ownership

In February 1994, Murdoch's News Corporation was forced to sell the paper, in order that its subsidiary Fox Television Stations could legally consummate its purchase of Fox affiliate WFXT (Channel 25) because Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy included language in an appropriations barring one company from owning a newspaper and television station in the same market.[14][15][16] Patrick J. Purcell, who was the publisher of the _Boston Herald_ and a former News Corporation executive, purchased the _Herald_ and established it as an independent newspaper. Several years later, Purcell would give the _Herald_ a suburban presence it never had by purchasing the money-losing Community Newspaper Company from Fidelity Investments. Although the companies merged under the banner of Herald Media, Inc., the suburban papers maintained their distinct editorial and marketing identity.

After years of operating profits at Community Newspaper and losses at the _Herald_, Purcell in 2006 sold the suburban chain to newspaper conglomerate Liberty Group Publishing of Illinois, which soon after changed its name to GateHouse Media. The deal, which also saw GateHouse acquiring _The Patriot Ledger_ and _The Enterprise_ respectively in south suburban Quincy and Brockton, netted $225 million for Purcell, who vowed to use the funds to clear the _Herald_'s debt and reinvest in the Paper.[17]

Boston Herald Radio

On August 5, 2013, the _Herald_ launched an internet radio station named Boston Herald Radio which includes radio shows by much of the Herald staff.[18][19] The station's morning lineup is simulcast on 830 AM WCRN from 10 AM Eastern time to 12 noon Eastern time.

Bankruptcy

In December 2017, the _Herald_ announced plans to sell itself to GateHouse Media after filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The deal was scheduled to be completed by February 2018, with the new company streamlining and having layoffs in coming months.[20][21] However, in early January 2018, another potential buyer, Revolution Capital Group of Los Angeles, filed a bid with the federal bankruptcy court; the _Herald_ reported in a press release that "the court requires BHI [Boston Herald, Inc.] to hold an auction to allow all potential buyers an opportunity to submit competing offers."[22]

Digital First Media acquisition

In February 2018, acquisition of the _Herald_ by Digital First Media for almost $12 million was approved by the bankruptcy court judge in Delaware. The new owner, DFM, said they would be keeping 175 of the approximately 240 employees the _Herald_ had when it sought bankruptcy protection in December 2017.[23] The acquisition was completed on March 19, 2018.[24]

The Herald and parent DFM were criticized for ending the ten-year printing contract[25] with competitor _The Boston Globe_,[26] moving printing from Taunton, Massachusetts, to Rhode Island[27][28] and its "dehumanizing cost-cutting efforts" in personnel.[29] In June, some design and advertising layoffs were expected, with work moving to a sister paper, _The Denver Post_.[30] The "consolidation" took effect in August, with nine jobs eliminated.[31]

In late August 2018, it was announced that the _Herald_ would move its offices from Boston's Seaport District to Braintree, Massachusetts, in late November or early December.[32]
