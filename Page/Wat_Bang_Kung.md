Somdet Phra Chao Yu Hua Phra Thi Nang Suriyat Amarin (King of Ayutthaya) commanded navy encamped and build the wall around Wat Bang Kung in the middle of the camp as a spirit center for soldiers. Burmese troops moved along Maeklong river until they found Bang Kung Camp. The army of Ayutthaya could not resist them. Finally, the camp was destroyed and become abandoned camp.[1]

Chinese troops fought and almost could not resist them until King Taksin the Great found out about the battle. King Taksin the Great and Maha Sura Singhanat jointly fought and defeated the Burmese. This victory affects many aspects including Thailand still being independent nation and gave them great encouragement.
