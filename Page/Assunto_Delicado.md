Background

In an interview for the site UOL[3] In May 2016, Joelma said she would like to have included more tracks of carimbó on her debut album, but that could not due to the short time it took to finalize the album. The singer said that she was working on some unpublished songs and promised that in her future DVD would have an unpublished carimbó that was left out of the album. The carimbó in question is the song _"Menina do Requebrado_" present in the EP.

Joelma sends a message to the SP no Ar in September 2016, already anticipating the news:

  _"Hi folks of the São Paulo no Ar! I have news for you: I'm releasing my second EP with four new songs that will come into my DVD, which will be recorded here in São Paulo on November 9 [...]"_.[4]

In 12 hours, the EP reached the third position among the most downloaded in iTunes Brazil.[5]
