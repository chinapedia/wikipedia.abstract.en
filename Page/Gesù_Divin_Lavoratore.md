JESUS THE DIVINE WORKER (Italian:_GESÙ DIVIN LAVORATORE_) is a titular church in Rome, in the Portuense district, on Via Oderisi da Gubbio.


History

The first stone of the building, designed by architect Raffaele Fagnoni, was laid March 24, 1955; May 15, 1960 was consecrated by Cardinal Clemente Micara. The dedication to Jesus worker was commissioned by the popes themselves as a sign of the Church's presence in the world of work. The church is home parish, established March 12, 1955 with the decree "Paterna solicitude"; in 1969 Paul VI awarded her the title of cardinal of "Jesus Divine Worker". Christoph Schönborn, OP is the incumbent cardinal-protector since 1998.


Description

It is circular in shape, and is characterized by the high bell tower, also in a cylindrical shape, which recalls so obvious a chimney. Outside it is red brick. Inside, you can see: the chancel floor, a crucifix agonizing over background multicolored tiles; the ceiling of reinforced concrete beams that recall, in a stylized way, the trusses of the old churches.
