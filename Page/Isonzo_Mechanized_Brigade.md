The Mechanized Brigade _Isonzo_ was a short-lived brigade of the Italian Army created during the 1975 army reform and renamed _Mantova_ during the 1986 army reform. The name of the brigade was chosen to commemorate the twelve Battles of the Isonzo during World War I.


History

Activation

In 1975 the Italian Army undertook a major reorganization of its forces: the regimental level was abolished and battalions came under direct command of multi-arms brigades. As tensions with Yugoslavia over the city if Trieste were allayed by the Treaty of Osimo and because a reduction of the military service from 15 to 12 months for the army and air force and from 24 to 18 months for the navy, forced the army to reduce its forces by nearly 45,000 troops it was decided that the Infantry Division _Mantova_ would contract to brigade. Therefore most units of the _Mantova_ division were either disbanded or reorganized during 1975 and on 21 October 1975 the remaining units of the division were used to raise the Mechanized Brigade _Isonzo_ in Cividale del Friuli. The brigade's command was created by elevating and renaming the command of the 76th Infantry Regiment _Napoli_ in Cividale del Friuli. After the activation the _Isonzo_ brigade entered the Mechanized Division _Mantova_ and consisted of the following units.

The brigade was tasked with defending the central part of the Yugoslav-Italian border against a possible Warsaw Pact invasion with the Alpine Brigade _Julia_ on its left flank and the Mechanized Brigade _Gorizia_ on its right flank.

Deactivation

During 1986 the Italian Army abolished the divisional level and brigades, that until then had been under one of the Army's four divisions, came forthwith under direct command of the Army's 3rd or 5th Army Corps. As the Mechanized Division _Mantova_ carried a historically significant name, the division ceased to exist on 1 October 1986 in Udine, but the next day in the same location the Mechanized Brigade _Mantova_ was activated. The new brigade took command of the units of the Mechanized Brigade _Isonzo_, whose name was stricken from the roll of active units of the Italian Army.
