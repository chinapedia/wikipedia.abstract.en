History

A canal called Khlong Thanon Trong (คลองถนนตรง; Thanon Trong canal; literally translates as "straight road canal") originally followed the route of the current day road. Around 1857 a parallel paved road was added. In 1919, Rama VI renamed the road Rama IV Road. In 1947 the canal was drained to make way for an extension of the road. The Paknam Railway, Thailand's first railway line, followed the route of Rama IV road from 1893 until it closed in 1960 due to under-use and increased road traffic. Several flyovers were added in the 1980s and 1990s to improve traffic flow.

Actually, this road is considered to be the first road in Thailand truly. It was built before Charoen Krung road round about four years. It was built in a similar case to Charoen Krung road. As westerner merchants of various nationalities gathered, they called on the Siamese government to build a new road. Due to the main transportation routes in those days were still used by waterways, it is much slower than the land route. At first it was built it has no official name. So people are popular called Thanon Trong (ถนนตรง; straight road) or Thanon Hua Lamphong (ถนนหัวลำโพง; Hua Lamphong road) according to its characteristics.[1]

The MRT Blue Line follows below Rama IV road between Hua Lamphong MRT Station and Queen Sirikit National Convention Center MRT Station.

Many important places are located on Rama IV road such as Hua Lamphong railway station, Wat Hua Lamphong, New Sam Yan Market, Lumphini Park and Rama VI Memorial Plaza, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai-Japanese Friendship Flyover, Channel 3 etc.
