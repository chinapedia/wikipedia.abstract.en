_IL PROSCRITTO_ (1841), revised as _DIE HEIMKEHR DES VERBANNTEN_ (1844) is an opera by Otto Nicolai.[1]

The libretto for _Il proscritto_ by Gaetano Rossi had been given to Nicolai after being rejected by Verdi, this after Nicolai had rejected and given to Verdi Temistocle Solera's libretto for _Nabucco_. Whereas, Verdi's opera was a triumph, Nicolai's, premiered 13 March 1841 at La Scala was a failure. On his return to Vienna Nicolai had Siegfried Kapper rework Rossi's libretto to produce _Die Heimkehr des Verbannten_, which premiered successfully 3 February 1844 at Vienna's Theater am KÃ¤rntnertor.
