_LECANORCHIS TABUGAWAENSIS_ is a species of orchid which belongs to the group of mycoheterotrophic plants. Mycoheterotrophs are known for feeding off of the roots of fungal hosts, instead of utilizing photosynthesis. Myco-heterotrophy refers to the harmonious relationship between particular plants and fungi. After a thorough exploration of the plant's shape, size, and structure, it was determined to be closely associated with orchidaceous Lecanorchis amethystea, although inward variations confirmed this unique species.

The plant was discovered in July 2015 by Yamashita Hiroaki in lowland forests on Yakushima island. This species is only found at two locations along the Tabu River. Other recent discoveries on this island include: _Oxygyne yamashitae_ (2008), _Gastrodia uraiensis_ (2015), and _Sciaphila yakushimensis_ (2016). This island also harbors various scarce plant species such as _Lecanorchis virella_, _Lecanorchis trachycaula_, _Yakushimense vexillabium_, _Apostoasia nipponica_, _Lycopodium sieboldii_, and _Lysionotus pauciflorus_.[1]


Etymology

The name of this plant stems from the Japanese name for the Tabu River, "Tabugawa".[2]


Description

The plant is approximately 20–40 cm long in size. It sprouts between July and August, containing approximately 5 flowers which are about 2–4 cm in size each.[3] The petals are yellowish white with a tint of purple. While at their peak they may become visible, however pairing their small size and limited maturing period, they are rarely seen.


Significance

_Lecanorchis tabugawaensis_, along with other mycoheterotrophs, are claimed to be a valuable part of the ecosystem. Such plants that survive without direct or high levels of sunlight could potentially have future research and practical implements.


Conservation

The population of _L. tabugawaensis_ contains less than 50 mature plants, and are not known from any other locality. Therefore, _L. tabugawaensis_ is classified as CR under Criterion D1 (IUCN 2014).[4] The island where the plant was discovered contains vast cedar forests and no restrictions on logging, this area is also not currently protected. The excessive logging in surrounding areas is threatening these plants and the entire fungal network.


Ecology

Certain plants, including _L. tabugawaensis_, no longer rely on insects for pollination, these plants have evolved to self-pollination.
