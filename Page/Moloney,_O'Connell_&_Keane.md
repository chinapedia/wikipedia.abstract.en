MOLONEY, O'CONNELL & KEANE is an early 1980s folk trio of traditional Irish music made up of guitarist and singer-songwriter Robbie O'Connell, banjoist and singer Mick Moloney and piano accordion virtuoso Jimmy Keane. The trio released two critically acclaimed albums: _There Were Roses_ in 1985 (including the first recording of the iconic Irish song "There Were Roses" that was penned by the famous Irish folk singer-songwriter Tommy Sands but recorded first by the trio) and the album _Kilkelly_ in 1987 including O'Connell's signature song "Killkelly".

Later on in the 1980s, all three became part of the revamped Green Fields of America an ensemble which performed and promoted Irish traditional music in the United States that included O'Connell, Moloney, Keane, plus fiddler Eileen Ivers (from Riverdance), multi-instrumentalist Séamus Egan (from Solas) and Donny and Eileen Golden. They recorded the album called _The Green Fields of America: Live_ released in 1989.
