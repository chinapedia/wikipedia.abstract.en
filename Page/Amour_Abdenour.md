AMOUR ABDENOUR (born February 17, 1952 in Leflaye, near Bejaia (Algeria)) is a Kabyle singer, songwriter and composer.


Life and career

As a young boy towards the end of the 50s, Abdenour was interested in music; he listened to songs on the radio and learned to play the flute, goblet drum (_darbouka_) and finally the guitar at age 11.

In 1964, while living with his grandparents, he joined the JFLN, a local cultural association which gave him the opportunity to enrich his talent by attending and participating in local events. In 1968, Abdenour moved to Algiers. A year later he wrote and composed his first song, named _Yeǧǧa-tt_ ("Left Alone"), which first aired on the radio in 1970. Busy with his studies and military duty, Amour Abdenour waited until the end of the 70s to release his first records, starting a long, ongoing career.[1]
