ZEEHAN MINERAL FIELD is a mining area near Zeehan in Western Tasmania, Australia.

The field is frequently associated with the short lived shallow silver deposits in the field,[1][2][3][4] which peaked in the 1890s [5] and early 1900s and had faded by the time of the first world war [6]

The field has a complex set of orebodies [7][8] and minerals and continues to be explored to the present.[9][10]

It is surrounded by long term mined and well searched areas â€“ the Dundas[11] and North-East Dundas [12] fields to the east, and the North [13] and South Heemskirk [14] fields to the west.

Trams, smelters and concentrating mills were spread throughout the field over the 1890s and early 1900s [15]
