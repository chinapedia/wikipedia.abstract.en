Lamium_purpureum_Closeup.jpg'', showing the bilaterally symmetrical flower]] Melissa_officinalis01.jpg The LAMIACEAE ([1]) or LABIATAE are a family of flowering plants commonly known as the MINT or DEADNETTLE or SAGE family. Many of the plants are aromatic in all parts and include widely used culinary herbs, such as basil, mint, rosemary, sage, savory, marjoram, oregano, hyssop, thyme, lavender, and perilla. Some species are shrubs, trees (such as teak), or, rarely, vines. Many members of the family are widely cultivated, not only for their aromatic qualities, but also their ease of cultivation, since they are readily propagated by stem cuttings. Besides those grown for their edible leaves, some are grown for decorative foliage, such as _Coleus_. Others are grown for seed, such as _Salvia hispanica_ (chia), or for their edible tubers, such as _Plectranthus edulis_, _Plectranthus esculentus_, _Plectranthus rotundifolius_, and _Stachys affinis_ (Chinese artichoke).

The family has a cosmopolitan distribution.[2] The enlarged Lamiaceae contain about 236 genera[3] and have been stated to contain 6,900[4] to 7,200[5] species, but the World Checklist lists 7,534.[6] The largest genera are _Salvia_ (900), _Scutellaria_ (360), _Stachys_ (300), _Plectranthus_ (300), _Hyptis_ (280), _Teucrium_ (250), _Vitex_ (250), _Thymus_ (220), and _Nepeta_ (200).[7] _Clerodendrum_ was once a genus of over 400 species,[8] but by 2010, it had been narrowed to about 150.[9]

The family has traditionally been considered closely related to the Verbenaceae;[10] in the 1990s, phylogenetic studies suggested that many genera classified in the Verbenaceae should be classified in the Lamiaceae [11][12] or to other families in the order Lamiales.[13]

The alternate family name Labiatae refers to the fact that the flowers typically have petals fused into an upper lip and a lower lip (__ in Latin). The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical with five united petals and five united sepals. They are usually bisexual and verticillastrate (a flower cluster that looks like a whorl of flowers, but actually consists of two crowded clusters). Although this is still considered an acceptable alternative name, most botanists now use the name Lamiaceae in referring to this family. The leaves emerge oppositely, each pair at right angles to the previous one (decussate) or whorled. The stems are frequently square in cross section,[14] but this is not found in all members of the family, and is sometimes found in other plant families.

These are marked with an asterisk (*) in the list below. A few genera have been established or resurrected since 2004. These are marked with a plus sign (+). The remaining genera in the list are mostly of historical interest only and are from a source that includes such genera without explanation.[16] Few of these are recognized in modern treatments of the family.

Kew Gardens provides a list of genera that includes additional information.[17] A list at the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website is frequently updated.[18]


Recent changes

The circumscription of several genera has changed since 2004. _Tsoongia_, _Paravitex_, and _Viticipremna_ have been sunk into synonymy with _Vitex_.[19] _Huxleya_ has been sunk into _Volkameria_.[20] _Kalaharia_, _Volkameria_, _Ovieda_, and _Tetraclea_ have been segregated from a formerly polyphyletic _Clerodendrum_.[21] _Rydingia_ has been separated from _Leucas_.[22] The remaining _Leucas_ is paraphyletic over four other genera.[23]


Subfamilies and tribes

In 2004, the Lamiaceae were divided into seven subfamilies with 10 genera not placed in any of the subfamilies.[24] The unplaced genera are: _Tectona, Callicarpa, Hymenopyramis, Petraeovitex, Peronema, Garrettia, Cymaria, Acrymia, Holocheila_, and _Ombrocharis_. The subfamilies are the Symphorematoideae, Viticoideae, Ajugoideae, Prostantheroideae, Nepetoideae, Scutellarioideae, and Lamioideae. The subfamily Viticoideae is probably not monophyletic.[25] The Prostantheroideae and Nepetoideae are divided into tribes. These are shown in the phylogenetic tree below.


Phylogeny

Most of the genera of Lamiaceae have never been sampled for DNA for molecular phylogenetic studies. Most of those that have been are included in the following phylogenetic tree. The phylogeny depicted below is based on seven different sources.[26][27][28][29][30][31][32]
