History

East Grinstead Cricket Club was founded in 1857. In 1989 the East Grinstead Cricket Club merged with nearby East Grinstead Hockey Club to create East Grinstead Sports Club Limited.[2] Following the merger the club sold the cricket ground and moved to the site of the hockey club, which owned its own land. Money from the sale was spent on a new pavilion, a new cricket square and an artificial sand pitch (used for hockey).[3] In 2017 the club won the Sussex Cricket League for the first time and reached the semi-finals of the National Club Championship, having beaten Bath in the quarter-finals.[4]
