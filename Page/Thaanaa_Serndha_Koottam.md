Plot

All the events in this movie happen in the period of 1986–1987. The film begins with Pallavaram Paranjothi Pandian (RJ Balaji) attending an interview for a clerk's post and getting rejected due to lack of money for giving bribes to the officials. Now the story shifts to Nachinarkiniyan aka Iniyan (Suriya) attending CBI interviews and his friend (Kalaiyarasan) attending police interviews. Both get rejected due to lack of bribe money for the post. Iniyan's father Porchelvan (Thambi Ramaiah) works as a CBI office clerk. He wants his son to be an officer, hence he pleads for the posting for his son to his higher officials. However, he earned the wrath of his senior official officer Uthaman (Suresh Chandra Menon), a corrupt official. Once during a raid, he asks for money. Porchelvan did not approve of this and complains about Uthaman in the form of an anonymous letter. Uthaman comes to know about this and exacts revenge by purposely rejecting and humiliating Iniyan at the interview and later asking him to bribe in order to get the job. Iniyan and his father are dejected, and Iniyan's friend is dejected due to his failure in the interview, and he later commits suicide. Iniyan is depressed after all these events and decides to loot money from the corrupted and rich people. He loots black money and tries to reform society, making sure the deserved people get posting in the government departments. He forms a gang with him and starts to heist by posing as CBI and income tax officers. The CBI appoints Kurunjivendhan (Karthik). Meanwhile, Iniyan falls in love with Madhu (Keerthy Suresh), and she accepts his marriage proposal. One day, the gang conducts an interview for the CBI (fake). The gang plans to raid a jewelry shop. Uthaman and Kurunjivendhan come to know of this but learn that they already came and finished the raid. Kurunjivendhan aprehends Iniyan and wants him to to be a police inspector, but he rejects the offer as he believes that even more good can be done if he continued to do his deeds. He then reveals the force with kurunjivendhan is actually the men he gave jobs using the heist money.He escapes the place with ease. Later on we see him escaping abroad with Madhu and all his other accomplices.

Production

Development

Following the success of Neeraj Pandey's _Special 26_ (2013), the director revealed that he was approached by several film makers who were keen on producing a Tamil version of the film. Linguswamy subsequently bought the rights of the film and planned to produce the venture in collaboration with Friday Filmworks, who had made the original version.[4][5] Linguswamy held initial discussions with Kamal Haasan, Suriya, Karthi and Vikram about portraying the film's lead role with Sathyaraj, but the production failed to materialise.[6] In August 2014, producer Thiagarajan announced that he had purchased the Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada language rights to remake _Special 26_, and revealed that he would also direct all four ventures. Thiagarajan's son Prashanth was revealed to be playing the lead role in the Tamil version, while Prakash Raj and Sathyaraj were signed to portray supporting roles.[7][8] A further press release in March 2015 stated that Srikanth Ravichandran, then husband of television host Divyadarshini, would instead direct the film and that he had already begun work on planning music compositions with Thaman. The team also revealed that they had signed on actress Trisha to feature in the leading female role.[9][10] After a period of little development, Prashanth revealed to the media in September 2015 that the film's shoot would commence soon after with Madhesh as the director of the project.[11]

A press release in December 2015 suggested that Simran and Devayani would also be a part of the cast, while Jacqueline Fernandez would appear in a song. It was also stated that Anirudh Ravichander had been signed on to compose the film's music and Sreekar Prasad would be the film's editor.[12] Thiagarajan revealed that he would adapt the original film's script and dialogues to suit a Tamil audience and that filming would take place in Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai.[13] The film failed to materialise over 2016 and it was widely reported in the media that the remake rights of the original film had been transferred from Thiagarajan to Studio Green and the film was to be made as _Thaana Serndha Kootam_ by Vignesh Shivan with Suriya in the lead role.[14][15] The title was taken from a dialogue spoken by Rajinikanth in _Baashha_ (1995).[16]

However in an interview during February 2017, Thiagarajan insisted that the film was still being planned with Prashanth in the lead role.[17] In late 2017, Thiagarajan made an application seeking an interim stay of the film's release, claiming that his studio of Staar Movies still owned the film's rights. He stated that Staar Movies had entered into an agreement with the original producers, Viacom, in August 2014 and obtained the rights to remake the movie in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada and that the agreement was valid for a period of three years. In early January 2018, the High Court refused the interim order application and called for the issues to be decided in a civil claim.[18][19]

Filming

Vignesh Shivan agreed to work on _Thaanaa Serndha Koottam_ at short notice, after another project, _Kaathu Vaakkula Rendu Kadhal_ with Vijay Sethupathi became delayed. Studio Green's K. E. Gnanavel Raja asked Vignesh to do a project to star Suriya and the team chose to use an earlier script planned by Vignesh on the 1987 Opera House heist, like _Special 26_, where a group posing as Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officers executed an income tax raid on the jeweller in Mumbai, which he initially wanted to make with either actors Sivakarthikeyan or Vijay Sethupathi.[20] The team claimed to legally purchase the remake rights of _Special 26_, but instead of copying the film scene-by-scene, Vignesh was insistent that it was adapted to make it suitable for Tamil-speaking audiences.[21][22] The film was announced to the public in September 2016, with the shoot starting thereafter in October 2016.[23][24] Keerthy Suresh was signed on as the lead actress, while an ensemble cast of veteran actors including Ramya Krishnan, Suresh Chandra Menon, Senthil and Sudhakar were also a part of the first schedule.[25]

The film was predominantly shot across Chennai and Mysore, with the shoot finishing in August 2017.[26][27] Post-production works for the film were completed at Knack Studios in Chennai. The film was also dubbed in Telugu as _Gang_, with Suriya choosing to dub for himself in Telugu for the first time.[28][29]


Music

The soundtrack and background score of the film were composed by Anirudh Ravichander, collaborating for the first time with Suriya, with lyrics for songs written by Thamarai, Vignesh Shivan and Mani Amudhavan. The team released four single tracks, before the album was unveiled on 6 January 2018. The promotional song for "Sodakku" included members of the film's cast as well as Sheril, who rose to fame with her dance cover of the song "Entammede Jimikki Kammal" from _Velipadinte Pusthakam_ (2017). A critic from Behindwoods.com noted "Anirudh's magical combination with Vignesh Shivan continues as the album shines high on variety", and gave the album a rating of 3.25 out of 5 stars.[30] Another reviewer from The Times of India wrote "Anirudh and Vignesh's combination has worked again – and the composer only proves, time and again, to experiment and give some fine tracks for each album he works on".[31]

The song "Sodakku" attracted controversy after an AIADMK office bearer, Sathish Kumar, lodged a complaint with the Commissioner of Police seeking changes in the lyrics, which he claimed were offensive and anti-political. Kumar's claims were widely criticised by those in the film industry, with RJ Balaji speaking out against the complaint.[32]

Three of the two tracks were also recorded in Hindi, with lyrics by Niharika Baijal.


Release

_Thaana Serndha Kootam_ got a worldwide release on 12 January 2018, two days before the Thai Pongal festival.[33] It was dubbed and released into Telugu as _Gang_. It was also dubbed into Hindi as _Surya Ki Gang_ (English: Surya's Gang) by Pen India having Suriya's voice dubbed by Aditya Raj Sharma.


Box office

The film collected 16cr from worldwide box office in its opening day of which 7cr in Tamil Nadu,1.9cr in Kerala, 1.1cr in Karnataka and over 6cr from rest of India and World.[34] The film collected 90cr from 10 days of its release.[35]
