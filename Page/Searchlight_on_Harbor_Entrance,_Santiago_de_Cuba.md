_SEARCHLIGHT ON HARBOR ENTRANCE, SANTIAGO DE CUBA_ is an early 20th century painting by American artist Winslow Homer. It is currently (2018) in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[1]

Executed in oil on canvas from sketches made by Homer in 1895, the painting depicts two cannon atop Castillo de San Pedro de la Roca, also known as Morro castle, a Spanish built fortress on the island of Cuba. The fort played a role in the decisive Battle of Santiago de Cuba in 1898, in which the United States Navy destroyed a Spanish fleet sheltering there. The image was painted after the event received much publicity in 1901 as a court of enquiry strove to apportion credit to the American commanders involved.

The work is on view at the Metropolitan in Gallery 767.
