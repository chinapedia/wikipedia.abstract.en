The CONGRESSIONAL UKRAINIAN CAUCUS, or the CUC, is a bipartisan[1] caucus of the United States House of Representatives that was announced in June 1997 in Washington, D.C., nearly six years after Ukraine declared its independence. Its mission is "organize an association of Members of Congress who share a common concern for building stronger bilateral relations between Ukraine and the United States." With the cooperation with the Ukrainian American community, the Caucus serves to lend support for Ukraine, beginning with democratization efforts and market-oriented reforms, and functions as a source of information for Members of Congress regarding events in Ukraine.

Its counterpart in the United States Senate is the Senate Ukraine Caucus, which was established in February 2015 and consists of 15 Senators.[2]
