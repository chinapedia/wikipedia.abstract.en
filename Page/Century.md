A CENTURY is a period of 100 years. Centuries are numbered ordinally in English and many other languages. The word _century_ comes from the Latin _centum_, meaning _one hundred_. _Century_ is sometimes abbreviated as C.[1]

A CENTENARY is a hundredth anniversary, or a celebration of this, typically the remembrance of an event which took place a hundred years earlier.


Start and end in the Gregorian calendar

Although a century can mean any arbitrary period of 100 years, there are two viewpoints on the nature of standard centuries. One is based on strict construction, while the other is based on popular perspective (general usage).

According to the strict construction of the Gregorian calendar, the 1st century AD began with 1 AD and ended with 100 AD, with the same pattern continuing onward. In this model, the _n_-th century started/will start on the year _(100 × n) − 99_ and ends in _100 × n_. Because of this, a century will only include one year, the centennial year, that starts with the century's number (e.g. 1900 was the last year of the 19th century).[2]

In general usage, centuries are aligned with decades by grouping years based on their shared digits. In this model, the 'n' -th century started/will start on the year _(100 x n) - 100_ and ends in _(100 x n) - 1_. For example, the 20th century is generally regarded as from 1900 to 1999, inclusive. This is sometimes known as the odometer effect. The astronomical year numbering and ISO 8601 systems both contain a year zero, so the first century begins with the year zero, rather than the year one.[3]

Alternative naming systems

Informally, years may be referred to in groups based on the hundreds part of the year. In this system, the years 1900–1999 are referred to as the _nineteen hundreds_ (_1900s_). Aside from English usage, this system is used in Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic and Finnish. The Swedish _nittonhundratalet_ (or _1900-talet_), Danish _nittenhundredetallet_ (or _1900-tallet_), Norwegian _nittenhundretallet_ (or '' 1900-tallet'') and Finnish _tuhatyhdeksänsataaluku_ (or _1900-luku_) refer unambiguously to the years 1900–1999.


Similar dating units in other calendar systems

While the century has been commonly used in the West, other cultures and calendars have utilized differently sized groups of years in a similar manner. The Hindu calendar, in particular, summarizes its years into groups of 60,[4] while the Aztec calendar considers groups of 52.[5]
