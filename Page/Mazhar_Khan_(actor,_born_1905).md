MAZHAR KHAN (1905â€“1950) was an actor-producer-director in Indian Cinema. He was acknowledged for his strong yet natural performances, best exemplified by his role in V. Shantaram's classic _Padosi_ (1941), wherein Mazhar, a Muslim,[1] enacted the role of an upper-caste Hindu.[2] He started his career as a police officer, which he left to study law for a short period. Abandoning his studies he came to Bombay and started his career in cinema with the silent film _Fatal Garland_ opposite the top actress of the time, Ermeline. He became a popular actor, gaining success in several silent films. During his stint in silent films he worked with well-established directors like Bhagwati Mishra, Ezra Mir, Moti P. Bhagnani, R. S. Chowdhary, and M. D. Bhavnani.[3] The magazines of those days, circa 1940s, compared Mazhar to Hollywood actors like Paul Muni, Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff.[4]

Mazhar Khan made a successful transition to Talkies with the end of the Silent Era. _Nurjehan_ (1931), directed by Ezra Mir, was his first Talkie picture. It received a positive response from the audiences establishing Mazhar as a profitable and dependable actor. He went on to work with the East India Film Company in Calcutta and Sagar Movietone, making films like _Sultana_, _Night Bird_, _Salima_ and _Sonhera Sansar_. He then moved back to Bombay and worked under Ranjit Movietone. Having established himself in the different roles he portrayed, he became renowned for he became renowned for his character depictions while also being respected in the film industry.[5]

He formed his own production company, Asiatic Pictures under the banner of which he first made _Yaad_ (1942) and then _Pehli Nazar_ (1945), the latter film referred to as his best directorial triumph in his obituary. He introduced actress Veena in _Yaad_ and Munawwar Sultana as a lead heroine in ''Pehli Nazar. His last role was in _Usha Kiran_.[6]


Early life

Mazhar Khan was born on 18 October 1905,[7] at Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India. He did his matriculation from Indore, Madhya Pradesh and then joined the police force in Dhar State. He rose to the rank of a sub-inspector before quitting it. Following his father's wishes he studied law but soon left that to come to Bombay and join films. His tenure with the police had trained him in horse riding and other "athletic abilities", which were to prove helpful to him in his cinematic career.[8]

In an interview (January 1942, Filmindia) Mazhar stated that the glamour of the Indian screen attracted him, with his interest in films growing with each new picture he saw. His desire to act in films drove him to a "frenzy", and he "rushed to Bombay, the Mecca of films".[9] Mazhar's entrance into films was hard, and he had to venture from one studio to another for work. According to Baburao Patel of _Filmindia_, the late Mr. B. P. Misra (B. P. Mishra) was the first to recognise the "potential box-office attraction" "in the young fugitive". Within a week Mazhar Khan was given a role in _Fatal Garland_, a "costume phantasy".[10]


Career

Silent films

Mazhar's debut film was _Fatal Garland_, directed by Bhagwati Prasad Mishra (B. P. Mishra/Bhagwati Mishra) and starring Ermeline, who was called the "queen of silent films". His role as Prince Ghiasudin was appreciated and he was inundated with films.[11] His other films from 1926-1931 during the silent era include _Durgesh Nandini_ (1926), _Hoor-E-Baghdad_ (1928), _Vasl Ni Raat_, _Be Dhaari Talwar_ (1929), _Ram Rahim_ (1930), _Hamara Hindustan_ (1930), Sinbad the Sailor (1930), Raj Tilak (1931) and Golibar (1931). Durgesh Nandini was directed by Bhagwati Prasad Mishra (B. P. Mishra) for Sudarshan Films and starred Ermeline and Madanrai Vakil. In his initial phase, he acted the villain in stunt films produced in that era. With the trend shifting to "mythological, historical and semi-social", he performed roles that required "a touch of extra realism".[12]

In 1927-28, Mazhar did two films. The one in 1927 for Imperial Film Company was _Gamdeni Gori_ also known as _Village Girl_. It was directed by Mohan Dayaram Bhavnani (M. D. Bhavnani) and co-starred Sulochana, Madanrai Vakil and Raja Sandow. The film is stated to be a "part of Imperial's calculated and successful effort to manufacture a star image for the actress (Sulochana)".[13] 1928 was _Hoor-E-Baghdad_ directed by Bhagwati Mishra. 1929 had five films starring Mazhar, variously directed by Mishra, Bhavnani and Altekar, with the production company remaining Imperial.

In 1930, he acted in six films five of which were for Imperial and one for Sagar Film Company. _Cinema Girl_, which was termed a "Modern Girl" social genre,[14] was directed by Bhagwati Mishra for Imperial Film Company and co-starred Prithviraj Kapoor and Ermeline. It "presented a fictionalised biography of its maker".[15] The film also marked the debut of actor Prithviraj Kapoor in a prominent role;[16] his first film being _Do Dhaari Talwar_ directed by Mishra.[17]

In 1940, Mazhar played an important role in _Achhut_, a film made to "promote Gandhi's movement against untouchability".[26] The cast included Motilal, Gohar Sitara Devi, and Noor Mohammed Charlie. It was produced by Chandulal Shah for his Ranjit Studios. The premiere was attended by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.[27] In _Bharosa_, Mazhar played the role of a man who leaves his wife (Sardar Akhtar, in the care of his trusted friend (Chandra Mohan) and his wife, when he has to go abroad on work. The resulting consequences form the basis of the story. The film was directed by Sohrab Modi for Minerva Movietone.[28]

In 1941, Mazhar acted in _Padosi_, directed by V. Shantaram for his Prabhat Film Company. It was made following communal tension at the formation of Muslim League. The film showed friendly relations between the Hindus and the Muslims. To achieve a better coalition, Shantaram had Mazhar Khan, a Muslim, playing the role of a Hindu and Gajanan Jagirdar, a Hindu, play the Muslim character.[29] Mazhar's role as 'Thakur" was claimed to be a difficult one, requiring "understanding of human psychology" and a "lot of attention". He emerged triumphant gaining positive critical acclaim.[30] The film had a positive response from both the critics as well as at the box-office, mainly due to its social and patriotic outlook.[31]

_Akela_ in 1941, was another box-office success, with Mazhar being praised for his strong "emotional role" of a lonely man, and credited for carrying the picture to "success on his shoulders". The film was directed by Pesi Karani for producer Kikubhai Desai and co-starred Bibbo and E. Billimoria.[32]

By January 1942, Mazhar had continuously worked for fourteen years in the film industry and acted in over 112 films.[33] He directed his first film in 1942, called _Meri Duniya_ on Hindu-Muslim unity, for National Artists, Bombay.

Shantaram.[35] The heroine was new to Hindi\Urdu cinema though she had earlier acted in successful Punjabi films.[36]

Under his new banner Mazhar Art Productions, Mazhar made _Badi Baat_ (1944) and _Pehli Nazar_ in 1945. _Pehli Nazar_ introduced Munawwar Sultana to the Indian film industry. The film was directed by Mazhar, with story, dialogues and lyrics by Safdar "Aah". Singer Mukesh, who made his debut as a playback singer in 1941, in _Nirdosh_, gained popularity from _Pehli Nazar_, with the song, "Dil Jalta Hai Toh Jalne De" (Let The Heart Smolder), which became "an instant hit".[37]
