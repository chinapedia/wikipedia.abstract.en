APIACEAE or UMBELLIFERAE is a family of mostly aromatic flowering plants named after the type genus _Apium_ and commonly known as the CELERY, CARROT or PARSLEY FAMILY, or simply as UMBELLIFERS. It is the 16th-largest family of flowering plants, with more than 3,700 species in 434 genera[1] including such well-known and economically important plants such as ajwain, angelica, anise, asafoetida, caraway, carrot, celery, chervil, coriander, cumin, dill, fennel, poison hemlock, lovage, cow parsley, parsley, parsnip and sea holly, as well as silphium, a plant whose identity is unclear and which may be extinct.[2]

The family Apiaceae includes a significant number of phototoxic species and a smaller number of poisonous species. Some species in the family Apiaceae are cytotoxic.


Description

Most Apiaceae are annual, biennial or perennial herbs (frequently with the leaves aggregated toward the base), though a minority are woody shrubs or small trees such as _Bupleurum fruticosum_.[3] Their leaves are of variable size and alternately arranged, or with the upper leaves becoming nearly opposite. The leaves may be petiolate or sessile. There are no stipules but the petioles are frequently sheathing and the leaves may be perfoliate. The leaf blade is usually dissected, ternate or pinnatifid, but simple and entire in some genera, e.g. _Bupleurum_.[4] Commonly, their leaves emit a marked smell when crushed, aromatic to foetid, but absent in some species.

The defining characteristic of this family is the inflorescence, the flowers nearly always aggregated in terminal umbels, that may be simple or more commonly compound, often umbelliform cymes. The flowers are usually perfect (hermaphroditic) and actinomorphic, but there may be zygomorphic flowers at the edge of the umbel, as in carrot (_Daucus carota_) and coriander, with petals of unequal size, the ones pointing outward from the umbel larger than the ones pointing inward. Some are andromonoecious, polygamomonoecious, or even dioecious (as in _Acronema_), with a distinct calyx and corolla, but the calyx is often highly reduced, to the point of being undetectable in many species, while the corolla can be white, yellow, pink or purple. The flowers are nearly perfectly pentamerous, with five petals, sepals, and stamens. The androecium consists of five stamens, but there is often variation in the functionality of the stamens even within a single inflorescence. Some flowers are functionally staminate (where a pistil may be present but has no ovules capable of being fertilized) while others are functionally pistillate (where stamens are present but their anthers do not produce viable pollen). Pollination of one flower by the pollen of a different flower of the same plant (geitonogamy) is common. The gynoecium consists of two carpels fused into a single, bicarpellate pistil with an inferior ovary. Stylopodia support two styles and secrete nectar, attracting pollinators like flies, mosquitoes, gnats, beetles, moths, and bees. The fruit is a schizocarp consisting of two fused carpels that separate at maturity into two mericarps, each containing a single seed. The fruits of many species are dispersed by wind but others such as those of _Daucus_ spp., are covered in bristles, which may be hooked in sanicle _Sanicula europaea_[5] and thus catch in the fur of animals. The seeds have an oily endosperm[6][7] and often contain essential oils, containing aromatic compounds that are responsible for the flavour of commercially important umbelliferous seed such as anise, cumin and coriander. The shape and details of the ornamentation of the ripe fruits are important for identification to species level.[8]


Systematics

Apiaceae was first described by John Lindley in 1836.[9] The name is derived from the type genus _Apium_, which was originally used by Pliny the Elder circa 50 AD for a celery-like plant.[10] The alternative name for the family, Umbelliferae, derives from the inflorescence being generally in the form of a compound umbel. The family was one of the first to be recognized as a distinct group in Jacques Daleschamps' 1586 _Historia generalis plantarum_. With Robert Morison's 1672 _Plantarum umbelliferarum distribution nova_ it became the first group of plants for which a systematic study was published.

The family is solidly placed within the Apiales order in the APG III system. It is closely related to Araliaceae and the boundaries between these families remain unclear. Traditionally groups within the family have been delimited largely based on fruit morphology, and the results from this have not been congruent with the more recent molecular phylogenetic analyses. The subfamilial and tribal classification for the family is currently in a state of flux, with many of the groups being found to be grossly paraphyletic or polyphyletic.[11]

Genera

According to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website , 434 genera are in the family Apiaceae.[12]

Ecology

The black swallowtail butterfly, _Papilio polyxenes_, uses the family Apiaceae for food and host plants for oviposition.[14] The 22-spot ladybird is also commonly found eating mildew on these shrubs.[15]


Uses

Many members of this family are cultivated for various purposes. Parsnip (_Pastinaca sativa_), carrot (_Daucus carota_) and Hamburg parsley (_Petroselinum crispum_) produce tap roots that are large enough to be useful as food. Many species produce essential oils in their leaves or fruits and as a result are flavourful aromatic herbs. Examples are parsley (_Petroselinum crispum_), coriander (_Coriandrum sativum_), culantro, and dill (_Anethum graveolens_). The seeds may be used in cuisine, as with coriander (_Coriandrum sativum_), fennel (_Foeniculum vulgare_), cumin (_Cuminum cyminum_), and caraway (_Carum carvi_).

Other notable cultivated Apiaceae include chervil (_Anthriscus cerefolium_), angelica (_Angelica_ spp.), celery (_Apium graveolens_), arracacha (_Arracacia xanthorrhiza_), sea holly (_Eryngium_ spp.), asafoetida (_Ferula asafoetida_), galbanum (_Ferula gummosa_), cicely (_Myrrhis odorata_), anise (_Pimpinella anisum_), lovage (_Levisticum officinale_), and hacquetia (_Hacquetia epipactis_).[16]

Cultivation

Generally, all members of this family are best cultivated in the cool-season garden; indeed, they may not grow at all if the soils are too warm. Almost every widely cultivated plant of this group is a considered useful as a companion plant. One reason is because the tiny flowers clustered into umbels, are well suited for ladybugs, parasitic wasps, and predatory flies, which actually drink nectar when not reproducing. They then prey upon insect pests on nearby plants. Some of the members of this family considered "herbs" produce scents that are believed to ...mask the odours of nearby plants, thus making them harder for insect pests to find.

Other uses

The poisonous members of the Apiaceae have been used for a variety of purposes globally. The poisonous _Oenanthe crocata_ has been used to stupefy fish, _Cicuta douglasii_ has been used as an aid in suicides, and arrow poisons have been made from various other family species.

_Daucus carota_ has been used as coloring for butter.

_Dorema ammoniacum_, _Ferula galbaniflua_, and _Ferula sumbul_ are sources of incense.

The woody _Azorella compacta_ Phil. has been used in South America for fuel.


Toxicity

Many species in the family Apiaceae produce phototoxic substances (called furanocoumarins) that sensitize human skin to sunlight. Contact with plant parts that contain furanocoumarins, followed by exposure to sunlight, may cause phytophotodermatitis,[17][18] a serious skin inflammation. Of all the plant species that have been reported to induce phytophotodermatitis, approximately half belong to the family Apiaceae.[19]

Phototoxic species include _Ammi majus_, the parsnip (_Pastinaca sativa_) and numerous species of the genus _Heracleum_, especially the giant hogweed (_Heracleum mantegazzianum_). The family Apiaceae also includes a smaller number of poisonous species, including poison hemlock, water hemlock, and fool's parsley.

Some members of the family Apiaceae, including carrot, celery, fennel, parsley and parsnip, contain polyynes, an unusual class of organic compounds that exhibit cytotoxic effects.[20][21]
