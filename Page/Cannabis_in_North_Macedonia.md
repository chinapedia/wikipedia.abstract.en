CANNABIS IN MACEDONIA is legal for medical purposes, but illegal for recreational purposes.


Medical cannabis

On February 9, 2016, the Macedonian Parliament Health Committee gave its approval for the legalization of medical marijuana.[1] Beginning in June 2016, patients without a prescription were allowed to buy oil with 0.2 per cent cannabinoids or less; more concentrated forms require prescription.[2]


Illicit production

Only small amounts of cannabis are grown in Macedonia, since the quality and price of cannabis in neighboring Albania is superior. The cannabis brought into Macedonia from Albania mostly originates from villages in the country where the majority of residents get their income from illegal cannabis production. It is then smuggled into Macedonia by the Albanian Mafia.
