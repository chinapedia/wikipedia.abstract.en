DANIEL POLLARD (born August 23, 1983), more commonly known by his stage name HXV (Heroes x Villains), is an American music producer. The first release from HXV was a mixtape titled _We Off That_, which was introduced under Diplo's Mad Decent label.[1] Following this was his debut EP titled _Run the Trap_. This included the song "Flex", which caught the attention of Diplo, later landing HXV the opportunity to remix Major Lazer's "Jah No Partial". The response to this remix was outstanding, thus securing him a spot in the community.[2]


Career

Pollard started DJing at the age of 15, and started HXV in 2009.[3] In 2012 HXV released his first mixtape, _We Off That_, on Mad Decent, which was hosted by both Lil' Jon and Cobra Corps. This release piqued the interest of both hip hop heads and dubstep bangers. HXV went on to remix songs by numerous artists, including The Weeknd, Young Jeezy and Charli XCX.[4]

In February 2012 HXV, alongside Diplo and Mayhem, produced a mixtape for ATL rap group FKI titled _Transformers in the Hood_.[5]

In January 2014, both Daniel Disaster and Pete H of HXV released their _Chapel_ EP. This was a collaboration with the fashion brand FRESH.i.AM and Red Bull.[6]

On April 14, 2015 they introduced fans to _Vultures_, a five-track EP featuring artists including Lil Uzi Vert, Rome Fortune, Ricky Remedy and Debroka.[7]

October 2016 brought light to HXV's emotional single "Novocaine" featuring Daniel Disaster's long time and close friend Naz Tokio. "Novocaine" centers around Daniel's sobriety and the challenges that come with it, Naz being representative of the disease that is addiction.[8]

On November 25, 2016, HXV released Volume 1 of his newly announced _Black Friday Mix_. The mix features various trap artists, including Eptic, Ekali, Mayhem and KRNE.
