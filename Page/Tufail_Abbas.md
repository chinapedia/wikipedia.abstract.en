TUFAIL ABBAS (born c. 1928[1]) is a Pakistani trade unionist and communist politician. He was a veteran labour leader in the airline industry, heading the Airways Employees Union.[2][3] In later years he served as chairman of the Pakistan Mazdoor Mahaz ('Pakistan Workers Front') and chief editor of the Urdu monthly _Awami Manshoor_.[4]


Airline industry union leader

Abbas was a union leader at Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) during four decades.[5][6] He had become an employee at Orient Airways in late 1948, and took part in the strike of March 1949.[7] When PIA acquired Orient Airways, Abbas became a PIA employee.[8] At the time PIA management and union leaders were in close contact, the PIA Managing-Director Malik Nur Khan sent Abbas to India to study labour practices at Air India.[9] Abbas was jailed on different occasions due to his labour activism.[10]


In the Communist Party

Abbas was recruited to the Communist Party of Pakistan in the early 1950s by Ahmed Aziz (who was later accused of having working as a government infiltrator).[11] At the time Abbas was working in the airline industry.[12] By the late 1950s Abbas held the post of secretary of the Karachi Committee of the Communist Party.[13] The Karachi Committee was hierarchically placed under the Hyderabad-baded Sindh Provincial Committee, but under Abbas' leadership the Karachi Committee became increasingly independent.[14] Apart from his base in the PIA union, Abbas also counted on support within the National Students Federation and some labour groups in the city.[15]


Sino-Soviet split

In 1966 the Sindh Provincial Committee was split in pro-Soviet and pro-China parties, a split taking place in the aftermath of the 1965 Indo-Pakistan war.[16] Abbas emerged as the general secretary of the underground, pro-Beijing Communist Party.[17] His group won the support of the majority in the National Students Federation.[18] Abbas was invited to the October 1 celebrations in China in 1966.[19]

After the 1966 split Abbas' faction began seeking to build an organization across West Pakistan.[20] It also had some contacts in East Pakistan.[21] Abbas' labour wing was known as the Quami Mazdoor Mahaz ('National Labour Front'), which emerged from the Markezi Mazdoor Committee in 1969.[22][23] The Airways Employees Union was the strongest union inside the Quami Mazdoor Mahaz.[24]


Alliance with Bhutto

Tacitly, the Abbas faction provided support to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.[25] In the late 1960s, some member of the Abbas' faction joined Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party on the instruction of the party and began occupying positions in the PPP.[26] Abbas' support base amongst students and workers played an important role in building the PPP in Karachi at its earliest phase.[27] One of the key leaders of Abbas' faction that became a PPP leader was Meraj Muhammad Khan.[28] Nevertheless, Abbas' group opted not to participate in the 1970 elections.[29]

In the context of the Bangladesh Liberation War, Abbas' faction opposed military action in East Pakistan at some points whilst maintaining a critical view of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Awami League.[30]


Sino-Albanian split

Abbas sided with Albania in the Sino-Albanian split.[31]


Autobiography

Abbas' autobiography _Subah ki lagan_ ('Yearning for Dawn') was published in 2010.[32][33]
