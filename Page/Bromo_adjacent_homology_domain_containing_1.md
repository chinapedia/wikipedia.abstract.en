BROMO ADJACENT HOMOLOGY DOMAIN CONTAINING 1 (BAHD1) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the _BAHD1_ gene. BAHD1 is involved in heterochromatin formation and transcriptional repression. [1]


Discovery

_BAHD1_ was first cloned from a human brain cDNA library and the coding sequence was named KIAA0945.[2] Bierne and colleagues further discovered the function of BAHD1 in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression.[3]


Function

BAHD1 acts as a co-repressor by interacting with a set of proteins that promote chromatin compaction and regulate transcription.[4][5] Tandem-affinity purification of the BAHD1-associated protein complex in human HEK293 cells identified MIER proteins (MIER1, MIER2, MIER3), histone deacetylase HDAC1 and HDAC2, histone H3K9 methyltransferase EHMT2, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1 alpha, HP1 beta, HP1 gamma), MBD1, TRIM28 and CDYL as partners of BAHD1.[6] Overexpression of BAHD1 in HEK293 cells induces large-scale chromatin condensation [7] and DNA methylation on autosomes.[8] The C-terminal BAH domain of BAHD1 acts as a reader for the epigenetic mark H3K27me3.[9] Ectopically expressed BAHD1 colocalizes with the heterochromatic inactive X chromosome (Xi).[10][11]


Animal studies

Ablation of the _Bahd1_ gene in the mouse alters placental development and results in hypocholesterolemia, hypoglycemia and decreased body fat.[12] _Bahd1_-haplodeficiency in mice decreases the efficiency of infection with the bacterial pathogen _Listeria monocytogenes_.[13]


Clinical significance

During infection of human epithelial cells with the pathogen _Listeria monocytogenes_, BAHD1 represses interferon-stimulated genes.[14] At specific stages of infection, a _Listeria_ nucleomodulin, LntA, acts as an inhibitor of BAHD1 and activates interferon-stimulated genes.[15][16] The BAHD1 gene is downregulated in the colon tissue in a mouse model of ulcerative colitis.[17]
