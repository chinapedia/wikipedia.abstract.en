LESLIE BRETHERICK (1926–2003) was a chemist and an “internationally recognized authority on laboratory safety”[1] especially remembered for writing the book which became _Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards_, an indexed guide to published data on dangerous chemical reactions. An obituary said “His contributions have improved the lives of countless millions, and I will aver, have saved the lives of thousands”.[2]


Life

Bretherick was born in 1926 [3] and received a BSc from the University of Liverpool in 1946[4] He worked for May & Baker from 1945 to 1960,[5] where a personal injury and a near-miss provoked his lifelong interest in the prevention of chemical accidents.[6] He then had two years in chemical production at L. Light & Co before moving to BP Research Centre, Sunbury-on-Thames, in 1962 where he stayed till his early retirement in 1982.[7] It was there that he produced his magnum opus, nearly 1000 pages summarizing published literature on chemical accidents and dangerous reactions, organised by individual compound in 1975.[8] A second edition followed in 1979. As well as corrections and additional reactions, this contained a new section dealing with groups of compounds and some other matters. A third edition followed in 1985, Bretherick having retired in 1982 in order to work full-time on the project.[9][10] In the preface to the 4th edition (1989) he announced that his eyesight was failing.[11] As a result, he did not contribute new material to further editions, which was done by others. The fourth edition onwards were titled _Bretherick’s Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards_.

In 1988, Bretherick received the American Chemical Society (ACS) Chemical Health and Safety Award for his outstanding contributions in the field of chemical health and safety.[12][13]

He was a Chartered Chemist and Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC). He also edited a RSC handbook on chemical laboratory hazards,[14] as well as numerous articles on chemical safety. He was selected as one of the RSC’s “175 Faces of Chemistry”[15] noting that his achievements were made despite poor eyesight (and eventual near blindness) and a stammer (he was an active member of the British Stammering Association).[16]

He died in April 2003, survived by his wife, Margaret.[17]
