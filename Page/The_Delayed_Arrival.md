Plot

Aunt Dahlia's magazine is in deep money trouble again so she wants to sell it to a Mr Trotter. To make it more saleable, she plans on paying a thousand pounds to a famous novelist for a story, which means she has to pawn her pearl necklace. Meanwhile, Lady Florence Craye has an on-off engagement with the homicidal Darcy "Stilton" Cheesewright, with Bertie being the cause of the break-ups. An expert is brought in to value the pearls, which have been replaced with fakes, and there is a race on to sell the magazine and get the real ones back in time. Aunt Dahlia wants help from Jeeves to find a pearl necklace she has pawned. Jeeves appears in drag in this episode to impersonate the novelist Daphne Dolores Morehead.
