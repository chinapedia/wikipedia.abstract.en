Reception

A review by _Publishers Weekly_ stated "Quoting a 2003 workplace study by COGNA Behavioral Health called "Worried at Work: Mood and Mindset in the American Workplace," Stack argues that workers are stressed to epidemic proportions. Building on the platform of the acronym "PRODUCTIVE," Stack, who holds an MBA and gives inspirational speeches, introduces 10 quizzes and consecutive chapters based on the productivity factors: preparation, reduction, order, discipline, unease, concentration, time mastery, information and equilibrium. By combining fill-in-the-blanks charts and lists with her established techniques, Stark presents a method of organization that can be individualized and effective."[8]

In their book _The 25 Best Time Management Tools & Techniques_, Pamela Dodd and Doug Sundheim rank _Leave the Office Earlier_ third on their list of "The Best Time Management Books".[9] while _The New York Times_ deemed “the best book of the bunch" of time management books it reviewed in June 2004.[10]
