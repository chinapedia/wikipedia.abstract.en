The CLAYTON SCHOOL is a historic structure located in Clayton, Iowa, United States. The two-story structure, composed of native limestone, reflects the prosperity of the mid-19th century when it was built.[1] It served as a school building into the late 20th century when the district consolidated with a neighboring school district because of declining enrollment. The building went on to serve as a city hall and community center. Completed in 1860, the rectangular building features bracketed eaves, and a gabled roof that is capped with dormers and an octagon-shaped cupola. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.[2]
