DANIEL (DANNY) MCFARLANE (born 30 March 1967) is a former boxer turned British AIBA boxing referee, whose most high-profile bout saw Shakur Stevenson (United States), take on Robeisy Ramirez (Cuba) in the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic bantamweight final.[1]

The 56 kg bantamweight final attracted enormous international coverage because Ramirez was the London 2012 Olympic gold champion, who had moved up a weight division, while Stevenson was an undefeated boxer of huge potential.[2]

Ramirez won the fight by a narrow points margin to become a double gold medalist but Stevenson’s defeat did not stop him being signed by boxing superstar Floyd Mayweather Jr. to a promotional agreement.[3][4]

The final was one of 39 bouts McFarlane officiated in at the 2016 Olympiad - judging 32 and refereeing seven. He was the only boxing referee from the UK selected for the finals.[5] He also served as a judge in the light-flyweight final won by Hasanboy Dusmatov, who went on to receive the Val Barker Trophy awarded to the best overall boxer in the tournament.[6]

As well as the Olympics, McFarlane has refereed in the 2016 African qualifiers, 2015 Asian championships, the Middleweight 75 kg Final at the 2015 World Elite Men's Finals in Doha, the Heavyweight 91 kg Final at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow (the only English boxing referee selected for the games), the 2013 University Games in Russia and 2012 Olympic qualifying events.[7][8] He also refereed the heavyweight 91 kg final at the Commonwealth Games, (Canada v New Zealand) in 2014, and the middleweight 75 kg final at the 2015 World Elite Men's finals in Doha, Qatar, (Cuba v Uzbekistan).
