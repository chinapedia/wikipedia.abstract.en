He has a net worth estimated of US$12 million (£9 million).[3][4]


Career

Internet personality

Charles is most known for his YouTube channel focusing on makeup which he launched on December 1, 2015. At its highest point (May 6, 2019) his channel had 16.6 million subscribers. It currently has 15.8 million. His channel also has over 1.6 billion views on YouTube. On May 11, 2019, he became the first ever YouTube personality to lose over 1 million subscribers in 24 hours.[5] At the 8th Streamy Awards he won the award for best channel in the Beauty category.[6]

Makeup

On October 11, 2016, at the age of seventeen, Charles became the first male spokesmodel for cosmetics brand CoverGirl, working alongside brand ambassador Katy Perry.[7][8][9][10][11][12]

In 2018, Charles collaborated with Morphe Cosmetics to release an eyeshadow palette. In January 2019, he was invited to Birmingham, England, to open the company's second UK store, where over 7,000 fans showed up to see him, causing parts of the city centre to come to a standstill.[13][14]

In March 2019, Charles did the makeup for Iggy Azalea's music video shoot for “Sally Walker”. He also made a cameo appearance in the video.[15]

Modeling

In 2017, Charles walked the runway for _MarcoMarco_'s _Six 1/2_ collection during Los Angeles Fashion Week.[16][17]


Controversies

In February 2017, Charles was criticized after tweeting a joke considered offensive about Africa and Ebola. He later issued an apology saying: “I am extremely sorry for what I said. There are no excuses. No one owes me forgiveness, but I've learned a lot from the experience. I hope that the people who might look up to me will be able to learn from my mistakes and not repeat them”.[18][19]

In March 2017, YouTube make-up artist Thomas Halbert posted screenshots of previous conversations with Charles where he admitted his story regarding his rise in notability was falsified. Charles originally claimed he had his high school prom photographs retaken with a ring light,[20] however the conversation revealed that he had actually edited the photographs.[21]

In April 2019, Charles said that he was not fully gay, and a 5.5 on the Kinsey scale, saying that “there have been girls in the past who I've thought were very, very beautiful. There's also been trans guys in the past, too, that I was really, really into for a moment in time”. These comments created controversy, and some claimed they were transphobic.[22] Charles apologized shortly after, releasing a statement saying that his comments were unintentionally transphobic, though that was not his intent, and that he should have chosen different words to convey what he meant.[23]

On May 10, 2019, long-time collaborator Tati Westbrook uploaded a 43-minute long video titled “_BYE SISTER ...”_ to her YouTube channel heavily criticizing Charles. In her video, Westbrook accused Charles of “manipulating people's sexuality”[24][25] and “using... fame, power and money to play with people's emotions”.[26] After this, Charles set a YouTube record for losing over 1 million subscribers in less than 24 hours. It continued to fall from 16.6 million subscribers around May 6, 2019 to a low point of 13.4 million on May 15, 2019, recovering somewhat in the days that followed. Westbrook's subscriber count increased by over four million over the same period.[27][28] Charles later uploaded an 8-minute response video titled “tati”, addressing the issues raised by Westbrook and apologizing to his fans and both her and her husband. This video received mostly negative feedback, with the video becoming one of the 10 most disliked videos in YouTube history.[29][30] On May 18, 2019, Charles made a second, 41-minute, video addressing the comments made by Westbrook, entitled “No More Lies”.[31][32] It presented evidence appearing to refute many of Westbrook's accusations and led to renewed support for Charles and criticism towards Westbrook. Soon after its posting, Charles regained a million subscribers and Westbrook lost two hundred thousand.[33][34] Westbrook later removed the “Bye Sister” video from her YouTube channel.[35] The saga sparked analysis relating to internet cancel culture, the alleged toxicity of YouTube's beauty community, stereotypes of gay men being predatory and profits made from online 'drama'.[36][37][38]
