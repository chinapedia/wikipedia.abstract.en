The MANNEQUIN CHALLENGE was a viral Internet video trend which became popular in November 2016, in which people remain frozen in action like mannequins while a moving camera films them, often with the song "Black Beatles" by Rae Sremmurd playing in the background.[1][2] The hashtag _#MannequinChallenge_ was used for popular social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram. It is believed that the phenomenon was started by students at a high school in Jacksonville, Florida.[3] The initial posting has inspired works by other groups, especially professional athletes and sports teams, who have posted increasingly complex and elaborate videos.

News outlets have compared the videos to bullet time scenes from science fiction films such as _The Matrix_, _X-Men: Days of Future Past_, _X-Men: Apocalypse_, _Lost in Space_ or _Buffalo '66_. Meanwhile, the participatory nature of the challenge on social media makes it similar to memes such as Makankosappo or the Harlem Shake.[4][5] Others have noted similarities with the HBO TV series _Westworld_, which debuted around the same time, where robotic hosts can be stopped in their tracks.[6]
