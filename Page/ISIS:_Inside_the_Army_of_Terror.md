Reception

_ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror_ has been praised by critics. Steve Negus of _The New York Times_ compared the book favorably to Jessica Stern and J. M. Berger's _ISIS: The State of Terror_ and Patrick Cockburn's _The Rise of Islamic State_, calling _ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror_ "the most comprehensive of the three." He added, "This account of the Islamic State in Iraq is a valuable summation, but it really shines when it reaches the group's entry into Syria starting in 2011. Weiss and Hassan use their own interviews with members to draw out the range of motivations for why Syrians join such an extreme organization."[2] James Traub of _The Wall Street Journal_ was similarly impressed by the work, observing, "If ISIS really were a business-school case, we would want to understand how its distinctive culture evolved. On this subject, Ms. Stern and Mr. Berger largely rely on second-hand sources. We must turn instead to _ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror_, by Michael Weiss and Hassan Hassan, who have talked to a great many of the jihadists themselves and tell a far more detailed and nuanced story."[3] Robin Yassin-Kassab of _The Guardian_ wrote, "Weiss and Hassan have produced a detailed and readable book. Their informants include American and regional military officials and intelligence operatives, defected Syrian spies and diplomats, and – most fascinating of all – Syrians who work for Isis (these are divided into categories such as politickers, pragmatists, opportunists and fence-sitters). The authors provide useful insights into Isis governance – a combination of divide-and-rule, indoctrination and fear – and are well placed for the task."[4]
