FREDERICK DOUGLASS HIGH SCHOOL is a secondary school located at 2000 Winchester Road on the eastern side of Lexington, Kentucky, US. The school is one of six high schools in the Fayette County Public Schools district and was constructed to reduce overcrowding at Bryan Station High School and Henry Clay High School.[1]

Frederick Douglass High School is named after the 19th century African-American abolitionist Frederick Douglass.[2] Opened in August 2017, the school is the newest high school in the Fayette County Public Schools system.


Controversy

About 9 months before the school opened, it was announced that the mascot of Frederick Douglass High School would be the "Stallions." Some viewed this as "inappropriate and sexist." (Quote from founder of the petition to change the stallions mascot). The controversy quickly gained traction and was soon featured in national newspapers.[3] The stallions name was quickly removed, but it was decided that a horse would be the mascot because the property Frederick Douglass is built on, was previously a horse farm.[4] With the school year rapidly approaching, Principal Lester Diaz was running out of options. The decision was made to ask the students on the first day of school to vote on a new name. The final decision, with 59% of the vote, was the Frederick Douglass "Broncos." [5]"Mustangs," "Racers," "Thoroughbreds" and, "Stampede" were also listed as options for students to vote on. (Stallions was not an option) [6]


Safety

On March 9, 2018, a student accidentally shot himself, causing 30-40% of students to leave.[7] It installed metal detectors, becoming the first Fayette County school to do so.[8] The school also installed a 192-camera system, access control with intercom and ID badging, and intrusion detection.[9]

On November 7, 2018, a student took a loaded handgun into the school after being checked with a hand-held metal detector. The student did not fire the gun and has said that he had no intent to fire it. It was later found that the handgun was stolen, and the student was charged with possession of a weapon on school property and possession of a stolen handgun.[10]
