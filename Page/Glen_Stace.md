GLEN STACE is a Canadian pop and rock singer and songwriter, most prominent in the early 1990s.[1] He is most noted for garnering a Juno Award nomination for Most Promising Male Vocalist at the Juno Awards of 1992.[2]

Originally from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan,[3] Stace began writing songs as a pastime while working in mining exploration in remote locations in northern Saskatchewan.[4] In 1989, he won a local radio "Homegrown" competition with his song "Runaround",[5] and competed in YTV's _Rock Showdown_ series.[6] Larry Wanagas then signed him to Bumstead Records, which released his debut album _Buddha Hotel_ in 1991.[7] The album's country rock style was commonly compared by critics to Neil Young, Steve Earle and John Fogerty.[8] The album peaked at #73 in _RPM_,[9] and "Runaround" peaked at #33 in the magazine's Top 40.[10]

He followed up in 1992 with _Road to Damascus_.[11] He subsequently lost his record deal, and reemerged in 2000 with the independently-released album _Redemption Game_.[12]
