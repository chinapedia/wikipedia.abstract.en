_MOONGLOW_ is a 2016 novel by Michael Chabon. The book chronicles the life of Chabon's grandfather, a WW2 soldier, engineer and rocket enthusiast who marries a troubled Jewish survivor from France and lives a challenging, wandering life in postwar America. Chabon tells the story using a mixture of strict memoir and creative fiction writing.[1] The narrator functions as a proxy for the author, Chabon.[2][3]


Plot summary

The novel is about the story of the author's (Chabon) grandfather. Throughout the book, the grandfather's name is not referred to.

The story is sort of a memoir, jumping around in time. It starts with the narrator stating how his grandfather got arrested.


Reception

Sam Sacks writing for _The Wall Street Journal_ appreciated the non-fiction elements of the novel in contrast to Chabon's other works. Sacks said, "_Moonglow_ is a movingly bittersweet novel that balances wonder with lamentation."[4] For _The New York Times_, Michiko Kakutani found that, "Mr. Chabon weaves these knotted-together tales together into a tapestry that’s as complicated, beautiful and flawed as an antique carpet. […] Although "Moonglow" grows overly discursive at times, it is never less than compelling when it sticks to the tale of Mike's grandparents — these damaged survivors of World War II who bequeath to their family a legacy of endurance, and an understanding of the magic powers of storytelling to provide both solace and transcendence".[5]

The book was discussed in January 2017 on BBC Radio 4's _Saturday Review_.[6]
