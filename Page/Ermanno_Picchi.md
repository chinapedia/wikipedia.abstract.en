ERMANNO PICCHI (7 June 1811 – 18 April 1856) was an Italian composer, pedagogue and music critic who played an active role in the musical life of Florence from 1836 until his early death in 1856.


Life and career

Picchi was born in Impruneta in the Province of Florence and studied composition under Ignazio Colson. His first opera, _Marco Visconti_ premiered at the Teatro del Cocomero in Florence in 1838. His second opera _Il tre novembre_ premiered in 1844 at the Teatro della Pergola. Over the course of his career he composed four operas, an oratorio, numerous pieces of sacred music, music for military bands, and two piano fantasias (both published by Ricordi) on themes from Donizetti's _La fille du régiment_ and Pacini's _Saffo_.[1][2]

He was appointed secretary of the Florence Conservatory (at the time an annex of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze) in 1850 and in 1852 succeeded Giovanni Pacini as its director. Picchi became the founding editor of the weekly journal _Gazzetta musicale di Firenze_ in 1853, providing critical guidance in its first two years of publication. Each issue came in two parts. The first had essays on music theory and criticism, while the second focused on reviews of noteworthy performances in Italy and the rest of Europe as well as literary and biographical articles. He also translated the libretto of Meyerbeer's _L'étoile du nord_ for its Italian premiere in 1856 as _La stella del nord_.[3]

Picchi died in Florence at the age of 44 from what was described at the time as "miliary fever". His daughter Elisa married the Florentine composer Giuseppe Ceccherini.[4][5]
