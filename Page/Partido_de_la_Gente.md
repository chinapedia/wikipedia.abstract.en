_PARTIDO DE LA GENTE_ (Spanish for "Party of the Folk") is a Uruguayan political party.


History

Founded in 2016, its main leader is Edgardo Novick.[1]

It already has three legislators: the Senator Daniel Bianchi and the Representative Guillermo Facello, both former Colorados, and the Representative Daniel Pe√±a, a former Blanco. Later, in early 2019, Bianchi was expelled from the party after driving under the effects of alcohol.[2]


Name

_Gente_ is a Spanish-language word for "people". There is also another synonym, _pueblo_. Locally, the word _pueblo_ may have a left-leaning or revolutionary connotation; notice the names of some previously existing political groups: _Partido por el Gobierno del Pueblo_ and _Partido por la Victoria del Pueblo_. So, the name of this party should be understood as "Party of the Folk", or "Party of the Plain Folks".

This new party stands for the political centre, and pretends to appeal to plain people who are tired of politics as usual, both traditional or contemporary (the current government being held by a leftist party).
