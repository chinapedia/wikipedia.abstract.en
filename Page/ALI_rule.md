The ALI RULE, or AMERICAN LAW INSTITUTE MODEL PENAL CODE RULE, is a recommended rule for instructing juries how to find a defendant in a criminal trial is not guilty by reason of insanity.[1] It broadened the M'Naghten rule of whether a defendant was so mentally ill that she is unable to "know" the nature and quality of her criminal act, or know its wrongfulness, to a question of whether she had "substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of [her] conduct".[2] It also added a volitional component as to whether defendant was lacking in "substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the law".[3] It arose from the case of ''United States v. Brawner.[4]

The ALI rule is:



        _"(1) A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease of defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law._
        _"(2) As used in this Article, the terms "mental disease or defect" do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct [Section 4.01]."_
