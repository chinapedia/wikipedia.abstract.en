It was released by DreamWorks Records on May 3, 2004 in the UK, and on August 17, 2004 in the US. It was produced by Steve Albini.[1] _CMJ_ described the voice of the band's lead singer, Lillian Berlin, as a "snarling Iggy-inspired baritone" and the album's songs as "scathing socio-political commentaries."[2]
