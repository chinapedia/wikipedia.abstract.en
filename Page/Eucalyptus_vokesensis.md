_EUCALYPTUS VOKESENSIS_, commonly known as the VOKES HILL MALLEE,[1] is a mallee that is native to South Australia.[2]


Description

The multi-stemmed mallee typically grows to a height of . It has grey to grey-brown bark on the stems and lower branches, with tan, grey, or cream bark above. The lower branches have rough and fibrous bark, while the higher branches have smoother bark.[3] The dull, grey-green, thick, and concolorous adult leaves have a disjunct arrangement. The leaf blade has a lanceolate, falcate, obtuse or rounded shape that is basally tapered. The simple axillary conflorescence contains between seven and eleven cream to yellow flowers. The fruits that form later have an ovoid or urceolate shape with a depressed disc and exserted valves.[4] The smooth dark brown to grey seeds within the fruit have an ovoid shape and are in length and half as wide.[5]


Taxonomy

The species was first formally described in 1999 by Dean Nicolle and Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson in the work _Systematic studies in the Eucalypts. A review of series Sociales (Eucalyptus subgenus Symphyomyrtus, Section Bisectaria, Myrtaceae)_ as published in the journal _Telopea_.[6]

The specific epithet comes from the locality in which the type specimen was found. Vokes Hill was named during an expedition by explorer Richard Maurice in 1901. His general hand and cook on the journey was W. Voke(s)[7] or Voakes.[8]


Distribution

The species is endemic to an arid area of western South Australia in the Great Victoria Desert where it grows in deep red sandy soils on and around sand dunes and broad swales in open mallee communities.[9]
