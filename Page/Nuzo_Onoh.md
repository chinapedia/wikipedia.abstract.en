NUZO ONOH (born 22 September 1962) is a British-Nigerian writer. She is a pioneer of the African horror subgenre.[1] Onoh's books _The Reluctant Dead_ (2014)[2] and _Unhallowed Graves_ (2015)[3] are both collections of ghost stories depicting core Igbo culture, traditions, beliefs and superstitions within a horror context. She is also author of _The Sleepless_ (2016) and _Dead Corpse_ (2017).[4][5][6]


Early life

Born in Enugu, Nigeria, Nuzo Onoh grew up the third of the eight children of the late Chief Mrs Caroline Onoh, a former headteacher. She experienced the Biafran war with Nigeria (1967â€“70) as a child refugee[7] and at the age of 13, she was the victim of an attempted "exorcism" by a local pastor. Because of this experience, she now advocates for greater awareness of ritual child abuse in African communities.[8]


Education

Nuzo Onoh attended Queen's School, in Enugu Nigeria, as well as The Mount School, a Quaker boarding school in York, and later, St Andrew's Tutorial College, Cambridge, England. Onoh holds a law degree and a master's degree in writing from Warwick University.[9]


Writing

Onoh's works have featured in numerous magazines and, to date, she is the only African horror fiction writer to have featured on _Starburst_, the world's longest-running magazine of cult entertainment.[10][11] She is listed in the reference book _80 Black women in Horror_ (Sumiko Saulson, 2017) and her stories have been included in several anthologies, including _Black Magic Women Anthology_, which features stories by some writers listed in _80 Black Women in Horror_. Her contentest-winning story, Guardians, featured in the Nosetouch Asterisk Anthology, Vol 2, (2018)is arguably, the first African Cosmic Horror story published. She has also featured on multiple media platforms, discussing her unique writing and African Horror as a genre. She has written several blogs for _Female First Magazine_.[12][13] Onoh has been mentioned as one of the new British horror writers bringing a positive change to how black and minority races are portrayed in mainstream horror fiction.[14]

Onoh has also given talks and lectures, including at the prestigious Miskatonic Institute of Horror Studies.[15]

Onoh writes about ghosts, vengeful African ghosts with unfinished business, and has been hailed as the "Queen of African Horror".[16] Her writings have been described as works of "magical realism and horror", exploring the "philosophical positions that define the reality of Africa and Africans in a world that is bent towards Western globalization and the annihilation of African roots in culture."[17] Her writing showcases both the beautiful and horrific in the African, mainly, Igbo culture and doesn't shy away from tackling issues of religious hypocrisy, child abuse, ritual killings, dangerous superstitions, corrupt politicians, evil witchdoctors and the plight of widows in the broader African culture, all within a fictitious horror context.[18] Her book _The Sleepless_, a ghost story tackling both the ritual abuse of children and the horrors of the Biafran War, has been described as "a genuine powerhouse of horror storytelling"[19] and as a work that "Goes beyond magical realism":[20] "What distinguishes her genre as 'African Horror' is the detailed exploration of African beliefs on the mysterious and the spiritual, which reveals a lot about the 'African Self'".[21]


Family

Onoh has two children, Candice Onyeama (actor, writer and film director)[22] and Jija Orka-Gyoh (student).
