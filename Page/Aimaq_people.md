The AIMAQ (), also transliterated as _Aimak_ and _Aymaq_, are a collection of Persian-speaking nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes.[1] Aimaqs live mostly in the West Central highlands of Afghanistan, immediately to the north of Herat, in Pakistan in the Kyber and Balochistan region and also to a much lesser amount in the Khorasan Province of Iran.[2] They speak a number of subdialects of the Aimaq dialect of Persian, however some southern groups of Taymani and Maleki Aymaqs have adopted the Pashto language.[3]

Aimaks were originally known as _chahar_ ("four") Aymaqs: the TAYMANI (the main element in the population of Ghor), the FIROZKOHI, the JAMSHIDI and the TEMURI.[4] Other sources state that the Aimaq Hazara are one of the _Chahar_, with the Temuri instead being of the "lesser Aimaqs" or _Aimaq-e digar_[5] ("other Aimaqs") along with the Tahiri, Zuri, Maleki, and Mishmast.


Origin and classification

Aymāq is a Turkic-Mongolic word that means "tribe" or "grazing territory". Aimaq Hazara and Temuri are the most Mongoloid of the Aimaqs. The Temuri and Aimaq Hazara live in yurts, whereas other Aimaqs live in traditional Afghan black tents.[6]

Afghanistan_ethnic_groups_2005.jpg (2005)]] Estimates of the Aimaq population vary between 250,000 and 500,000. They are largely Sunni Muslims--except for the Jamshidi who are mainly Ismaili Shia in the main--and in contrast to the Hazara, who are mostly Shia Muslims.[7]
