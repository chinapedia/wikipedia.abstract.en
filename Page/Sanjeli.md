History

In 1159, Sanjeli state was founded by a Chauhan Rajput of the Songira clan from Jalore. The same dynasty ruled this principality for nearly 900 years. It became a British protectorate in 1820. During the period 1820 to 1937, the territory of the state remained stable at 88 square kilometers of beautiful undulating land inhabited mainly by simple, good tribal people. In 1892, the state had a population of 3,751.

It became a third class state in Rewa Kantha Agency's Rewa Kantha division (until its 1937 merger with Baroda State into Baroda and Gujarat States Agency). The Maharaja enjoyed a privy purse of 40,000 rupees. In 1901 - 1914 it was under direct British India administration due to minority rule.

On 10 June 1948, it ceased to exist by accession to the Bombay State at India's independence.
