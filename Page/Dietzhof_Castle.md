DIETZHOF CASTLE () was a high medieval water castle on the site of House No. 42 in the village of Dietzhof, in the municipality of Leutenbach in the county of Forchheim in the south German state of Bavaria.

The castle appears in the records in 1433, its owners being named as the lords of Stiebar. All that is left today are two barrel vaulted rooms in the barn of the house. In the south wall there are arrow slits and to the west of them are the remains of a circular moat.
