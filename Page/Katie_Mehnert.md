KATIE MEHNERT is an American entrepreneur, business author, and speaker who is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Pink Petro, a global social media platform created for women professionals in the energy industry.[1][2][3][4][5]


Career

Mehnert worked as a Management Consultant from 1997-2004 in the energy industry with Enron, Duke Energy, Waste Management, and Entergy. She left her position to join Shell as a Global Program & Change Leader in 2004, having stayed for 7 years working in health and safety.[6] She then joined BP as the director of culture, safety and operational risk after the Deepwater Horizon spill.[7][8]

In 2013, during a flight from London to Houston, the idea of Pink Petro came to mind.[9][10] She left BP to launch Pink Petro in 2014 to focus on improving the livelihoods of women professionals in the energy industry by creating a social media and a learning community.[11][12][13] She launched the community with initial support from Shell, Halliburton and KPMG.

A year later, the HERWorld Energy forum was started in 2016 as a way for the energy industry to celebrate International Women’s Day .[14]


Education

Mehnert received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Louisiana State University in 1997 and later attended Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Business, in 2009, for executive education in energy. She is a graduate of the Center for Houston’s Future.[15]


Awards

For her advocacy in gender equality in the energy sector, Mehnert was named a Top 40 under 40 in The Houston Business Journal.[16] She was named a Top Woman to Watch in Energy[17] and a Top 50 Houston Woman.[18] She’s also received the Vanguard Award for developing a pool of talent in STEM careers from Girls Inc, and the recipient of the YWCA’s Top Woman in Energy.[19]


Hurricane Harvey

In August 2017, Mehnert lost her West Houston home and business due to the federal ordered reservoir releases made by the United States Army Corps of Engineers during Hurricane Harvey.[20][21] While Harvey dumped a few feet of water into her home, the Mehnert's were able to stay on the second story. But a controlled release of nearby reservoirs washed through neighborhoods like hers in west Houston, submerging many homes above the first story. She and her daughter were rescued by volunteers Aug. 29.[22]


Philanthropy

Mehnert is the founder and chairman of the board of Lean In Energy,[23] a global organization aimed at helping women in energy achieve their ambitions through mentoring initiatives. Lean In Energy is and independent organization, affiliated with LeanIn.Org, which works closely with LeanIn.Org to further its mission and is licensed by LeanIn.Org to use the ‘Lean In’ name.

Mehnert is married and has one child. They live in Houston, Texas.
