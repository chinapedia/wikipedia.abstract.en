Colonel ALEKSANDR NIKOLAYEVICH POTEYEV was the former Deputy Head of Directorate "S" of the Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia) from 2000-2010.[1]

Beginning around 1999, he had begun working secretly with the CIA, helping to reveal a hidden network of Russian spies operating within the United States, known as the Illegals Program.

In late June 2010, a successful operation to extract Poteyev from Russia had been executed with the assistance of the CIA.

He is currently living in the United States under an assumed identity.[2][3][4]


Early life

Poteyev was born in the Brest Region of the Republic of Belarus. His father, Nikolai Pavlovich Poteyev, had been declared a Hero of the USSR in 1944 for having destroyed nine enemy tanks.[5][6]


Career

1970's

Poteyev had enlisted in the army during the 1970s. Afterward, he had entered the service of the KGB, working primarily in Minsk. Soon thereafter, he had traveled to Afghanistan as part of several elite Special Forces units, including "Zenith", "Cascade-1", and "Cascade-2".[7]

For his services in Afghanistan, he had been awarded the Order of the Red Banner. After returning from Afghanistan, Poteyev had graduated from the Academy of Foreign Intelligence, and then had gone on to work for the First Chief Directorate of the USSR.[8]

1990's

Working under official cover as a representative from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia), Poteyev had taken around a dozen short trips to several western countries during the 1990s, including Mexico, Chile, and New York City in the United States.[9][10]

According to a Russian court, Poteyev had begun passing information about Russian sleeper agents under his command to the CIA around 1999.[11][12][13][14]

2000's

In 2000, Poteyev had been appointed to Deputy Head of Directorate "S" of the SVR, where he had been tasked with overseeing a network of spies living inside the United States.[15][16]

Sometime around 2001, Poteyev is reported to have "cashed in" with the CIA, arriving on a contract that had ranged from somewhere between $2 and $5 million.[17]

On January 25, 2003, Poteyev's wife, Marina, had filed a police report claiming that three individuals disguised as law enforcement had broken into the Poteyev's apartment in Moscow. Once inside, the individuals are said to have robbed and attacked members of the Poteyev family.[18][19]

2010's

In the first half of 2010, the SVR had begun to suspect that a high-ranking mole had been operating within their system. Plans had later been made to administer lie detector tests to personnel within the SVR. Poteyev had known about this plan, and had later directed his son in June 2010 to travel to the United States, where Poteyev's wife and daughter had already been living.[20][21]

In May 2010, Poteyev had reportedly asked permission from his superiors to travel to Odessa to visit a purported mistress of his, but the request was denied.[22]

On June 24, 2010, without having informed his superiors beforehand, Poteyev had purchased a rail ticket from Moscow to Minsk. From there, he had made his way to Ivano-Frankivsk, then on to Frankfurt, before finally arriving at CIA headquarters in the United States on June 26, 2010.[23] The following day, on June 27, 2010, the FBI had begun arresting the Russian spies who had been operating within the United States under Poteyev's direction.[24][25]


Life in America

On November 11, 2010, Russian news agency Kommersant had erroneously reported that the individual responsible for betraying the Russian spies had been Colonel Alexandr Shcherbakov of the SVR. Five days later, however, Kommersant had issued a correction to the story, noting that the blame alone belonged to Poteyev.[26]

On June 27, 2011, a Russian court had found Poteyev guilty of high treason, and had had him sentenced in absentia to 25 years in prison.[27]

Sometime in or around the autumn of 2014, a Russian assassin within the United States is reported to have tracked the whereabouts of Poteyev, as well as members of his family.[28][29]

On July 7, 2016, Russian news agencies had reported unconfirmed rumors that Poteyev had died while in the United States.[30][31]
