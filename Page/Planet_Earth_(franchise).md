_PLANET EARTH_ is a television and film documentary franchise produced and broadcast by the BBC. The franchise began in 2001 with the success of _The Blue Planet_. As of 2017, _The Blue Planet_ has spawned 5 series and one feature film.


Development

In 2001 the BBC broadcast _The Blue Planet_, a landmark series on the natural history of the world's oceans. It received critical acclaim, high viewing figures, audience appreciation ratings, and many awards. It also became a hugely profitable global brand, eventually being sold to 150 countries worldwide. Feedback showed that audiences particularly liked the epic scale, the scenes of new and unusual species and the cinematic quality of the series. Programme commissioners were keen for a follow-up, so Alastair Fothergill decided that the Natural History Unit should repeat the formula with a series looking at the whole planet. The idea for _Planet Earth_ was born, and the series was commissioned by Lorraine Heggessey, then Controller of BBC One, in January 2002.[1]

A feature film version of _Planet Earth_ was commissioned alongside the television series, repeating the successful model established with _The Blue Planet_ and its companion film, _Deep Blue_. _Earth_ was released around the world from 2007 to 2009. There was also another accompanying television series, _Planet Earth: The Future_, which looked at the environmental problems facing some of the species and habitats featured in the main series in more detail.


Television series

Planet Earth (2006)

_PLANET EARTH_ is a 2006 British television series produced by the BBC Natural History Unit. Five years in the making, it was the most expensive nature documentary series ever commissioned by the BBC and also the first to be filmed in high definition.[2]

_Planet Earth_ premiered on 5 March 2006 in the United Kingdom on BBC One, and by June 2007 had been shown in 130 countries. The series has eleven episodes, each of which features a global overview of a different biome or habitat on Earth. At the end of each fifty-minute episode, a ten-minute featurette takes a behind-the-scenes look at the challenges of filming the series.

Planet Earth: The Future (2006)

_PLANET EARTH: THE FUTURE_ is a 2006 BBC documentary series on the environment and conservation, produced by the BBC Natural History Unit as a companion to the multi-award-winning nature documentary _Planet Earth_. The programmes were originally broadcast on BBC Four immediately after the final three episodes of _Planet Earth_ on BBC One. Each episode highlights the conservation issues surrounding some of the species and environments featured in _Planet Earth_, using interviews with the film-makers and eminent figures from the fields of science, conservation, politics, and theology. The programmes are narrated by Simon Poland and the series producer was Fergus Beeley.

Saving Planet Earth (2007)

_SAVING PLANET EARTH_ is a season of nature documentaries with a conservation theme, screened on BBC Television in 2007 to mark the 50th anniversary of its specialist factual department, the BBC Natural History Unit.

The series featured films contributed by a number of celebrities on the plight of various endangered species, and coincided with the launch of the BBC Wildlife Fund, a charitable organisation which distributes money to conservation projects around the world. The television series culminated in a live fundraising telethon on BBC Two, hosted by Alan Titchmarsh, which raised over £1 million for the charity.

The BBC broadcast a second live telethon in 2010. _Wild Night In_ was presented by Kate Humble, Chris Packham and Martin Hughes-Games and featured conservation projects which had benefited from the support of the BBC Wildlife Fund. This helped to raise a further £1 million.

Planet Earth Live (2012)

_PLANET EARTH LIVE_ is a live action nature documentary screened on British television. Produced by the BBC Natural History Unit and broadcast in May 2012, the programme was presented by Richard Hammond and Julia Bradbury.[3]

_Planet Earth Live_ featured real-time footage of young animals from five continents[4] throughout the month of May.[5] Broadcast three times per week, teams of nature experts and documentary makers monitored the activity of animals in their area, reporting back on the day’s events.[6] Animals featured included meerkats in the Kalahari Desert, American black bears in Minnesota, lions and African bush elephants in East Africa, toque macaques in Sri Lanka, gray whales off the coast of California, polar bears in Svalbard and giant otters in Peru.

The programme was shown in May 2012 on BBC One in the United Kingdom and was broadcast in 140 countries in total, making it the most ambitious global wildlife series the BBC had ever undertaken.[7] In the US it was retitled _24/7 Wild_ and aired on NatGeo Wild; in South Africa, Asia, Australia, Italy, Nordic countries, New Zealand and Poland it was shown on BBC Knowledge; and in India on BBC Entertainment.[8]

Planet Earth II (2016)

_PLANET EARTH II_ is an ongoing natural history documentary series, produced by the BBC as a sequel to the highly successful _Planet Earth_ television series, which aired roughly a decade earlier, in 2006.[9] The series will be presented and narrated by Sir David Attenborough with the score composed by Hans Zimmer.[10]

The first trailer was released on 9 October 2016, and the series is set to broadcast in November 2016 (United Kingdom) on BBC One and BBC One HD.[11][12] _Planet Earth II_ will mark the first television series that the BBC have produced in Ultra-high-definition (4K).[13][14]


Feature film

Earth (2007)

Alongside the commissioning of the television series, BBC Worldwide and GreenLight Media secured financing for a US$15 million film version of _Planet Earth_.[15] This followed the earlier success of _Deep Blue_, the BBC's 2003 theatrical nature documentary which used re-edited footage from _The Blue Planet_.[16] The film was co-directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield and produced by Alix Tidmarsh and Sophokles Tasioulis. Only 30% of the footage shown in _Earth_ is new, with the remainder being reworked from the television series to suit the narrative of the film.[17] David Attenborough was replaced as narrator by high-profile actors: Patrick Stewart for the UK market and James Earl Jones for the United States.[18][19] _Earth_ had its worldwide premiere in September 2007 at the San Sebastián International Film Festival in San Sebastián, Spain, in Basque Country.[20] Lionsgate released the film in several international markets over the following year. In the United States, it became the first film to be released by Disneynature, the Walt Disney Company's new nature documentary arm.[21] When released on Earth Day 2009 it set the record for the highest opening weekend gross for a nature documentary, and went on to become the third highest grossing documentary of all time.[22][23] It has grossed more than $108 million worldwide; in the nature documentary genre, only _March of the Penguins_ has achieved greater box-office success.[24]
