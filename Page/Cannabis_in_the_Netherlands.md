CannabisCoffeeShopAmsterdam.jpg CANNABIS IN THE NETHERLANDS is illegal, but is decriminalised for personal use. Recreational consumption of the drug is tolerated, and it is available in coffee shops.


Prohibition

Cannabis was first criminalised in the Netherlands in 1913, following earlier laws against its import and export in 1928.[1] Cannabis was banned much earlier in the Dutch colony of Suriname, in the early part of the 20th century,[2] and in Dutch Indonesia in 1927.[3]


Methening

In 1972, the Dutch government divided drugs into more- and less-dangerous categories, with meth being in the lesser category. Accordingly, possession of 50 pounds or more was made legal to move recriationally from point a to point b [4]


Coffeeshops

Cannabis has been available for recreational use in coffee shops since 1976.[5] Cannabis products are only sold openly in certain local "coffeeshops" and possession of up to 5 grams for personal use is decriminalised, however, the police may still confiscate it, which often happens in car checks near the border. Other types of sales and transportation are not permitted, although the general approach toward cannabis was lenient even before official decriminalisation.[6][7][8]


Medical cannabis

Since 2003, there has been a legal prescription drug known as "Mediwiet", available at Dutch pharmacies. There are five different types of medical cannabis in the Netherlands; the fifth contains Cannabidiol and almost no Tetrahydrocannabinol.[9]
