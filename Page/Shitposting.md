SHITPOSTING is posting large amounts of content of "aggressively, ironically, and trollishly poor quality"[1] to an online forum or social network,[2][3][4][5] in some cases intended to derail discussions or otherwise make the site unusable to its regular visitors.[6]


In politics

In May 2016 _The Daily Dot_ wrote that a shitpost is "a deliberate provocation designed for maximum impact with minimum effort".[7]

In September 2016 the pro-Donald Trump group _Nimble America_ received widespread media attention.[8][9][10] _The Daily Beast_ described the group as "dedicated to 'shitposting' and circulating internet memes maligning Hillary Clinton".[11]

In September 2016 _The Independent_ wrote that shitposting is an apolitical "tool that can be put to a variety of effects".[12] However, posts such as these have appeared long before the 2016 US presidential election. _Engineering & Technology_ magazine wrote that "[s]hitposting, whether from the left or right, is perilously close to delivering an online metastasis of Orwell's Two-minute Hate ".[13]

In November 2016 _Esquire_ magazine wrote that "Internet mockery was emerging as a legitimate political technique: shitposting. Maybe the 2020 election would be all shitposting."[14]

In March 2018, talking about Facebook group New Urbanist Shitposting or New Urbanist Memes for Transit-Oriented Teens, _Chicago_ magazine defined it as "posts that are meant to be awkward and irrelevant, aggravating and distracting social media communities from discussing their topic at hand".[15][16]

Writing in Polygon, Sam Greszes compared shitposting to Dadaism's "confusing, context-free pieces that, _specifically_ because they were so absurd, were seen as revolutionary works both artistically and politically". Greszes writes that the goal of shitposting is "to make an audience _so confused_ at the lack of content that they laugh or smile".[17]
