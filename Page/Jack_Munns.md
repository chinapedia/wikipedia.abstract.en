Club career

Early career

After starting his footballing career with Leyton Orient, Munns joined Tottenham Hotspur at a young age.[1] After failing to make a breakthrough at Tottenham, Munns joined League Two side Aldershot Town on a one-month loan deal.[2] However, Munns failed to make an impression under manager Dean Holdsworth, and therefore returned to North London without a senior appearance to his name. On 30 June 2013, Munns was released at the end of his contract with Tottenham.[3]

Preceding his release from Tottenham, Munns joined Championship side Charlton Athletic on a one-year deal.[4] Following an impressive season playing for the Charlton Athletic youth sides, Munns was allocated the squad number 27, for the 2014–15 campaign.[5] Although, Munns appeared on the Charlton bench several times, he failed to make his professional debut under managers Bob Peeters and Guy Luzon.

Cheltenham Town

On 11 May 2015, Munns joined National League side Cheltenham Town on a one-year deal.[6] On 8 August 2015, Munns made his Cheltenham Town debut in a 1–1 draw against Lincoln City in the opening matchday of the season, scoring the opener within twenty-six minutes.[7] On 3 October 2015, Munns went on to score a hat-trick in a 7–1 thrashing against FC Halifax Town, scoring in the 12th, 91st and 93rd minute.[8] Munns went on to score four more goals in the 2015–16 campaign, as Cheltenham triumphed by winning promotion back into the Football League.

On 9 May 2017, it was announced that Munns would leave Cheltenham upon the expiry of his contract in June 2017.[9]

Dagenham & Redbridge

On 6 September 2018, he signed for National League side and hometown club Dagenham & Redbridge on a deal until the end of the season, having been on trial.[10] In May 2019, it was announced that he would be released following the expiration of his contract at the end of the 2018–19 campaign.[11]
