HMS _DOLPHIN_ was originally the steam merchant ship _Seti_ built in 1902 by Sir Raylton Dixon & Co Ltd.[1] She was purchased by the Admiralty for the Royal Navy in November 1914, renamed _Pandora_, and used as a depot ship. She was renamed _Dolphin_ in 1924 and was sunk by a mine laid by German submarine U-22 in 1939, without loss of life.[2] She was lost on her last trip while being towed to Cambois to be stripped of usable parts and scuttled as a blockship at Scapa Flow.[3]
