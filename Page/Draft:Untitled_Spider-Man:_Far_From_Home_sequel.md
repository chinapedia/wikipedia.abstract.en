Co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is intended to be the sequel to 2017's _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ and 2019's _Spider-Man: Far From Home_, and a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is reported to be directed by Jon Watts and written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommer, and star Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man.

Production

In 2017, during the production of _Spider-Man: Homecoming_, Tom Holland revealed that the Marvel Cinematic Universe's _Spider-Man_ franchise was planned to be trilogy, with the second film planned to be set during Peter Parker's junior year and a potential third that would occur during his senior year of high school.[1][2]

Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios' initial agreement to share the character rights of Spider-Man was reported to last for five films, with the fifth film being _Spider-Man: Far From Home_ (2019).[3] Holland, however, had signed a contract for six films with Marvel.[4] After the launch of Sony's Marvel Universe in 2018 with the commercial success _Venom_, the future of the third film was put into question, with speculation that Sony may not renew the contract with Marvel of the expiration of the deal.[5] In May 2019, Holland reiterated that he would appear in one more film in the franchise, and was open to appearing in more sequels in the future.[6] In July 2019, Kevin Feige stated that the third film would feature "a Peter Parker story that has never been done before on film" due to the film's mid-credits scene.[7]
