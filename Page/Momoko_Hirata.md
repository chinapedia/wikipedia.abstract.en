Early life and training

Born in 1985[1] in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, Hirata began training in classical ballet at the Reiko Yamamoto Ballet School.[2] She attended the Royal Ballet School and in 2001 she won the Prix de Lausanne.[3][4] She danced the Princess Aurora variation from _The Sleeping Beauty_.


Career

In 2003, Hirata joined the Birmingham Royal Ballet. She was promoted to First Artist in 2005 and to Soloist in 2008.[5] In 2010, she was further promoted to First Soloist.[6] In 2011, she joined the Barcelona Ballet before returning to the Birmingham Royal Ballet the following season.[7] She was promoted from First Soloist to Principal in 2013.[8] Judith Mackrell, a critic for _The Guardian_, has described Hirata as "astoundingly fast and crystal clear in the ballerina role. Every detail of rhythm and style has a bevelled finish so that, even within the most pressured rush of a phrase, each step sings."[9] In her role as The Princess in John Cranko's _The Prince of the Pagodas_, Mark Monahan from _The Telegraph_ noted that it was "performed with an enchanting grace - first melancholic, then joyful - by the beautiful Japanese-born dancer Momoko Hirata."[10]

As Juliet in Sir Kenneth MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet her performance was positively received.[11] _The Herald_ noted "Hirata is perfectly cast as Juliet - exquisitely marrying the vulnerability and playfulness of a young Juliet in the nursery scene, with the passionate and ardent sensuality of her later love scenes with Romeo."[12]

Her repertory includes Polyhymnia in _Apollo_, _Agon_, _Serenade_, and _Western Symphony_ by George Balanchine. Lady Elgar in _Enigma Variations_, _Dante Sonata_, _La fille mal gardée_, _Scènes de ballet_ and _Les Deux Pigeons_ by Sir Frederick Ashton.
