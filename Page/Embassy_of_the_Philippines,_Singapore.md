History

A Philippine diplomatic presence was established in Singapore in 1966, one year after the country's independence from Malaysia, despite the absence of formal diplomatic relations. Full diplomatic relations between the two countries was only established in 1969.[1]

The first Philippine diplomatic mission in Singapore was a consulate-general that opened in 1967 along Orchard Road, near the premises of the Royal Thai Embassy. In 1986, the Embassy relocated to a newly-built building on Nassim Road, where it remains today.[2]


Staff

The Philippine Embassy in Singapore is headed by Ambassador Joseph del Mar Yap. As of 2014, the mission had a total of 60 staff members representing five different government departments, consisting of six consuls and vice-consuls, 26 expatriate staff hired by the Department of Foreign Affairs, 14 Singapore-based locally-hired employees, and 18 representatives of different government agencies.[3]

Among the agencies with a presence at the mission include the Department of Labor and Employment, the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Department of National Defense, the Social Security System, and the Home Development Mutual Fund (Pag-IBIG Fund). While the trade mission of the Department of Trade and Industry in Singapore is part of the Embassy,[4] it maintains separate offices along Orchard Road.

With over 180,000 Filipinos in Singapore, there is one embassy official for every 4,000 people, and the Embassy has complained of being short-staffed.[5]
