GEOFFREY CHARLES RYMAN (born 1951) is a Canadian writer of science fiction, fantasy, slipstream and historical fiction.


Biography

Ryman was born in Canada and moved to the United States at age 11. He earned degrees in History and English at UCLA, then moved to England in 1973, where he has lived most of his life.[1][2] He is gay.[3]

In addition to being an author, Ryman started a web design team for the UK government at the Central Office of Information in 1994.[4] He also led the teams that designed the first official British Monarchy and 10 Downing Street websites, and worked on the UK government's flagship website www.direct.gov.uk.[5]


Works

Ryman says he knew he was a writer "before [he] could talk", with his first work published in his mother's newspaper column at six years of age.[6] He is best known for his science fiction; however, his first novel was the fantasy _The Warrior Who Carried Life_, and his revisionist fantasy of _The Wizard of Oz_, _Was..._, has been called "his most accomplished work".[7]

Much of Ryman's work is based on travels to Cambodia. The first of these, _The Unconquered Country_ (1986) was winner of the World Fantasy Award[8] and British Science Fiction Association Award. His novel _The King's Last Song_ (2006) was set both in the Angkor Wat era and the time after Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge.[9]

Ryman has written, directed and performed in several plays based on works by other writers.

He was guest of honour at Novacon in 1989 and has twice been a guest speaker at Microcon, in 1994 and in 2004.[10][11][12] He was also the guest of honour at the national Swedish science fiction convention Swecon in 2006,[13] at Gaylaxicon 2008,[14] at Wiscon 2009,[15] and at Åcon 2010.[16]

Mundane science fiction is a subgenre of science fiction focusing on stories set on or near the Earth, with a believable use of technology and science as it exists at the time the story is written. The Mundane SF movement was founded in 2002 during the Clarion workshop by Ryman and others.[17] In 2008 a Mundane SF issue of _Interzone_ magazine was published, guest-edited by Ryman, Julian Todd and Trent Walters.[18]

Ryman currently lectures in Creative Writing for University of Manchester's English Department.[19]

As of 2008 he was at work on a new historical novel set in the United States before their Civil War.[20]
