Description

_Eucalyptus decurva_ is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The bark is smooth, white-gray, salmon to yellow-green and sometimes powdery. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull greyish green leaves arranged in opposite pairs, oblong to elliptic or egg-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, glossy green, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are pendulous and arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are more or less cylindrical to pear-shaped, long and wide. Flowering occurs between April to October and the flowers are white to pale pink. The fruit is a pendulous, woody, more or less spherical capsule long and wide on a pedicel long.[2][3][4]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus decurva_ was first formally described in 1863 by Ferdinand von Mueller from a specimen collected by George Maxwell near the Porongurups and the description was published in _Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae_.[5][6] The specific epithet (_decurva_) is a Latin word meaning "down-curved", referring to the flower buds.[7]


Distribution and habitat

Slender mallee grows in sandy and lateritic soils in hilly coastal and near-coastal areas, mostly between the Stirling Range and Esperance but with disjunct populations near Perth.[8][9]
