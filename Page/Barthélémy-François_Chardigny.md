BARTHÉLÉMY-FRANÇOIS CHARDIGNY (1757-1813) was a French sculptor. He designed public sculptures in Marseille.


Early life

Barthélémy-François Chardigny was born on September 4, 1757 in Rouen, France.[1][2] He learned sculpture under Augustin Pajou.[3]


Career

Chardigny was a sculptor. He won the Prix de Rome in sculpture in 1782.[4] Colone-de-la-peste-Marseille.jpg Chardigny moved to Aix-en-Provence to design sculptures for the Palace of Justice in 1784.[5] He designed marble sculptures of King René and King Henry IV, a sculpture of the Greek mythology figure Venus, two fountains, a large sculpture with three figures, and another sculpture named _Despotisme renversé_.[6] However, they were removed during the French Revolution, and moved to the Ecole Centrale (then in Aix and later moved to Marseille) in 1802.[7]

Chardigny moved to Marseille, where he was commissioned a statue representing Liberty for the townhall in 1798.[8] He subsequently designed the same statue for many townhalls.[9] Meanwhile, he was commissioned other public sculptures by the city of Marseille.[10] For example, he designed the fountain on the Place des Capucines, then known as the _place des fainéants_; it was later dismantled and replaced with another fountain designed by Dominique Fossati, although the basin remains Chardigny's.[11] Meanwhile, Chardigny became a member of the Académie de Marseille in 1800.[12]

Chardigny moved to Paris in 1808, where he designed sculptures of Juno and Jupiter in the Louvre Palace.[13]


Personal life, death and legacy

Chardigny married and had a son, Pierre Joseph Chardigny, in 1794.[14] He died on March 3, 1813 in Paris.[15] Eight of his sculptures are in the permanent collection of the Musée des beaux-arts de Marseille,[16] while more sculptures are held at the Musée Granet in Aix-en-Provence.[17][18]
