SPATHULENOL is a tricyclic sesquiterpene alcohol which has a basic skeleton similar to the azulenes. It occurs in oregano among other plants.


History and occurrence

A volatile oil was extracted from waterwort distillery (_Artemisia vulgaris_) and tarragon (_Artemisia dracunculus_), from which the sesquiterpene alcohol spathulenol was isolated for the first time in 1975 as a colorless, viscous compound with an earth-aromatic odor and bitter-spicy taste.[1]
