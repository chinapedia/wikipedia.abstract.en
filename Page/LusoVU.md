Products

EYESPEAK is the first autonomous system with an augmented reality interface by eye-tracking, especially designed for people with extreme mobility and communication limitations (for example ALS), that enables the possibility of communicating through the user’s eyes, in any position and orientation of the user's head.[3]

It was developed with the support of a crowdfunding campaign in Kickstarter launched in June 2014. The campaign reached full funding by 2014-07-15 with 111% of the value.[4]

LISPLAY is an Augmented Reality technology concept developed by LusoVU that puts a transparent display in front of the user’s eyes making it as thin and light as normal glasses. It has a much bigger field of view comparing to similar products.[5]

The Lisplay technology was considered by David Holz, LeapMotion’s CEO as one of the most promising future Head Mounted Display.[6]


Recognitions

Eyespeak was one of the nominates for the best hardware in the exposition in the Augmented World Expo – AWE 2015.[7] The company participated at the 2016’s edition of Web Summit,[8] as a winner of the Road to Web Summit initiative, which took 66 Portuguese startups as exhibitors.[9]
