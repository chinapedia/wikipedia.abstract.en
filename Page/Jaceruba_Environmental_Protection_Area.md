History

Before the APA was created the area was used for hunting, capture of wild animals for sale and extraction of hearts of palm. Restaurants by the roadside freely advertised the sale of bush meat. The area was also under pressure from real estate speculators due to the expansion of the metropolitan arc of Rio de Janeiro.

The Rio São Pedro de Jaceruba Environmental Protection Area was created by municipal decree 6.492 of 6 June 2002. On 5 November 2002 by municipal decree 6.547 it was renamed the APA Jaceruba (Jaceruba Environmental Protection Area).

The APA is part of the Central Rio de Janeiro Atlantic Forest Mosaic, created in 2006. On 20 January 2010 Maria Emilia Nascimento wrote to Carlos Minc, federal Minister of the Environment, asking for help in ensuring the safety of representatives of the APA on the council of the mosaic.
