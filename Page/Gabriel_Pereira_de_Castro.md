Works

Gabriel Pereira de Castro wrote some books about law. He is however known chiefly for his epic poem _Ulisseia ou Lisboa Edificada_ (_Ulisseia or Lisbon Built_). It consists of ten books.[3] It is written in ottava rima.[4] Its form is typical for Renaissance epic poems. The poem imitates _The Lusiads_ by Luís Vaz de Camões. It is about the founding of the town of Lisbon by Ulysses (Odysseus).[5] The book was published posthumously by poet's brother Luís Pereira de Castro in 1636.[6] He wrote poems in Latin and Spanish, too.[7] _Ulisseia_ is considered to be one of the most significant Portuguese epic after Camões.[8]
