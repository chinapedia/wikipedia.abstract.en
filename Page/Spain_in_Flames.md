_SPAIN IN FLAMES_ is a 1937 compilation film made by Helen van Dongen during the Spanish Civil War.[1] Hal Erickson has written that the film "... is remarkable in its willingness to offer both sides of the conflict -- though its sympathies are firmly with the Loyalists."[2] The film consists of two parts. The first, "The Fight for Freedom", was based on film footage from a Spanish government documentary _Spain and the Fight for Freedom_.[3]

The second part, "They Shalt Not Pass", was based on a short film _No Pasaran!_ done by the Artkino Film Company of the Soviet Union, where van Dongen was working at the time the film was made.[4][5][6] John Dos Passos narrated parts of the film,[7] and the commentary was written by Dos Passos, Ernest Hemingway, Archibald MacLeish, and Prudencio de Pareda.[8][9] Erickson writes that, "The horrendous images of battlefield carnage, not to mention the close-ups of suffering and dying Spanish children, still pack a wallop when seen today."[10]

Later, Hemingway, Dos Passos, Lillian Hellman and others founded the company Contemporary Historians, which produced another film called _The Spanish Earth_ (1937), directed by Joris Ivens and edited by van Dongen.
