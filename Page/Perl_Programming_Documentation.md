_PERL PROGRAMMING DOCUMENTATION_, also called _PERLDOC_, is the name of the user manual for the Perl 5 programming language. It is available in several different formats, including online in HTML and PDF. The documentation is bundled with Perl in its own format, known as Plain Old Documentation (pod). Some distributions, such as Strawberry Perl, include the documentation in HTML, PDF, and pod formats.

PERLDOC is also the name of the Perl command that provides "access to all the documentation that comes with Perl", from the command line.
