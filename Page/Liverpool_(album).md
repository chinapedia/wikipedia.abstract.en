_LIVERPOOL_ is Frankie Goes to Hollywood's second and final studio album, released in October 1986. It would be the band's final album of all-new material, and lead singer Holly Johnson would leave the band following the corresponding world tour, followed by a flurry of lawsuits from ZTT. The album's production was handled by Trevor Horn's engineer Stephen Lipson, who urged the band to play their own instruments on this album (Horn having replaced many of the band's performances and arrangements with his session musicians or his own performances on _Welcome to the Pleasuredome_.) _Liverpool_ therefore features a heavier rock sound than its predecessor.

The album was a commercial disappointment compared to the band's previous effort, though it charted generally high at #5 in the United Kingdom and Germany, #7 on the Austrian and Swiss music charts and #8 in Norway. The cover photo was different depending on what format was purchased (LP, cassette, or compact disc). It also produced the Top 5 single "Rage Hard" (#1 in Germany), Top 20 single "Warriors of the Wasteland" and Top 30 single "Watching the Wildlife".
