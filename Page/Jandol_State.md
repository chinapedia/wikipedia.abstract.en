JANDOL (also called JANDOOL or JANDUL) was a small Pashtun (Muslim) princely state during the British raj, yet yielded the "Napoleon of the Pathans" Umra Khan.

The Muslim khanate was a minor 'Frontier State' in the colonial Northwest Frontier Province, founded circa 1830. Its capital was a town called Barwa (which has various namesakes in British India).
