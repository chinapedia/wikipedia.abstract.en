neighborhood of Tokyo, a popular gathering site for _otaku_]]

is a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests, particularly in anime and manga. Its contemporary use originated with Akio Nakamori's 1983 essay in _Manga Burikko_.[1][2] _Otaku_ may be used as a pejorative; its negativity stems from a stereotypical view of _otaku_ and the media's reporting on Tsutomu Miyazaki, "The Otaku Murderer", in 1989. According to studies published in 2013, the term has become less negative, and an increasing number of people now self-identify as _otaku_,[3] both in Japan and elsewhere.

_Otaku_ subculture is a central theme of various anime and manga works, documentaries and academic research. The subculture began in the 1980s as changing social mentalities and the nurturing of otaku traits by Japanese schools combined with the resignation of such individuals to become social outcasts. The subculture's birth coincided with the anime boom, after the release of works such as _Mobile Suit Gundam_ before it branched into Comic Market. The definition of _otaku_ subsequently became more complex, and numerous classifications of _otaku_ emerged. In 2005, the Nomura Research Institute divided _otaku_ into twelve groups and estimated the size and market impact of each of these groups. Other institutions have split it further or focus on a single _otaku_ interest. These publications classify distinct groups including anime, manga, camera, automobile, idol and electronics _otaku_. The economic impact of _otaku_ has been estimated to be as high as ¥2 trillion ($18 billion).[4]


Etymology

_Otaku_ is derived from a Japanese term for another person's house or family ( _otaku_). This word is often used metaphorically, as an honorific second-person pronoun. In this usage, its literal translation is "you". For example, early in the anime _Macross_, first aired in 1982, the characters Hikaru Ichijyo and Lynn Minmay use the term this way to address one another, until they get to know each other better.[5][6] The modern slang form, which is distinguished from the older usage by being written only in hiragana (おたく), katakana (オタク or, less frequently, ヲタク) or rarely in rōmaji, first appeared in public discourse in the 1980s, through the work of humorist and essayist Akio Nakamori. His 1983 series , printed in the lolicon magazine _Manga Burikko_, applied the term to unpleasant fans in caricature. Animators Haruhiko Mikimoto and Shōji Kawamori had used the term between themselves as an honorific second-person pronoun since the late 1970s.[7] Supposedly, some fans used it past the point in their relationships where others would have moved on to a less formal style. Because this misuse indicated social awkwardness, Nakamori chose the word itself to label the fans.[8] Morikawa Kaichirō, an author and lecturer at Meiji University, identified this as the origin of its contemporary usage.[9][10]

Another claim for the origin of the term comes from the works of science fiction author Motoko Arai, who used the word in her novels as a second-person pronoun and the readers adopted the term for themselves. However, a different claim points to a 1981 _Variety_ magazine essay.[11][12]

In 1989, the case of Tsutomu Miyazaki, "The Otaku Murderer", brought the fandom, very negatively, to national attention.[13] Miyazaki, who randomly chose and murdered four girls, had a collection of 5,763 video tapes, some containing anime and slasher films that were found interspersed with videos and pictures of his victims. Later that year, the contemporary knowledge magazine _Bessatsu Takarajima_ dedicated its 104th issue to the topic of _otaku_. It was called and delved into the subculture of _otaku_ with 19 articles by _otaku_ insiders, among them Akio Nakamori. This publication has been claimed by scholar Rudyard Pesimo to have popularized the term.[14]


Usage

In modern Japanese slang, the term _otaku_ is mostly equivalent to "geek" or "nerd" (both broad sense; common sense of geek would be "tech otaku" (技術オタク) and common sense of nerd would be "intellectual otaku" (文化系オタク) or "gariben"(ガリ勉)), but in a more derogatory manner than used in the West.[15] However, it can relate to any fan of any particular theme, topic, hobby or form of entertainment.[16] "When these people are referred to as otaku, they are judged for their behaviors - and people suddenly see an “otaku” as a person unable to relate to reality".[17][18] The word entered English as a loanword from the Japanese language. It is typically used to refer to a fan of anime/manga but can also refer to Japanese video games or Japanese culture in general. The American magazine _Otaku USA_ popularizes and covers these aspects.[19][20] The usage of the word is a source of contention among some fans, owing to its negative connotations and stereotyping of the fandom. Widespread English exposure to the term came in 1988 with the release of _Gunbuster_, which refers to anime fans as _otaku_. Gunbuster was released officially in English in March 1990. The term's usage spread throughout rec.arts.anime with discussions about _Otaku no Video_{{'}}s portrayal of _otaku_ before its 1994 English release. Positive and negative aspects, including the pejorative usage, were intermixed.[21] The term was also popularized by William Gibson's 1996 novel _Idoru_, which references _otaku_.[22]


Sub-culture

Morikawa Kaichirō identifies the subculture as distinctly Japanese, a product of the school system and society. Japanese schools have a class structure which functions as a caste system, but clubs are an exception to the social hierarchy. In these clubs, a student's interests will be recognized and nurtured, catering to the interests of _otaku_. Secondly, the vertical structure of Japanese society identifies the value of individuals by their success. Until the late 1980s, unathletic and unattractive males focused on academics, hoping to secure a good job and marry to raise their social standing. Those unable to succeed socially focused instead on their interests, often into adulthood, with their lifestyle centering on those interests, furthering the creation of the _otaku_ subculture.[23]

Even prior to the coinage of the term, the stereotypical traits of the subculture were identified in a 1981 issue of _Fan Rōdo_ (Fan road) about "culture clubs".[24] These individuals were drawn to anime, a counter-culture, with the release of hard science fiction works such as _Mobile Suit Gundam_. These works allowed a congregation and development of obsessive interests that turned anime into a medium for unpopular students, catering to obsessed fans. After these fans discovered Comic Market, the term was used as a self-confirming and self-mocking collective identity.[25]

The 1989 "Otaku Murderer" case gave a negative connotation to the fandom from which it has not fully recovered. The usage of "(interest) otaku", however, is used for teasing or self-deprecation, but the unqualified term remains negative.[26] The identification of _otaku_ turned negative in late 2004 when Kaoru Kobayashi kidnapped, sexually assaulted, and murdered a seven-year-old first-grade student. Japanese journalist Akihiro Ōtani suspected that Kobayashi's crime was committed by a member of the figure moe zoku even before his arrest.[27] Although Kobayashi was not an _otaku_, the degree of social hostility against _otaku_ increased. _Otaku_ were seen by law enforcement as possible suspects for sex crimes, and local governments called for stricter laws controlling the depiction of eroticism in _otaku_ materials.[28]

Not all attention has been negative. In his book, _Otaku_, Hiroki Azuma observed: "Between 2001 and 2007, the otaku forms and markets quite rapidly won social recognition in Japan", citing the fact that "[i]n 2003, Hayao Miyazaki won the Academy Award for his _Spirited Away_; around the same time Takashi Murakami achieved recognition for otaku-like designs; in 2004, the Japanese pavilion in the 2004 International Architecture exhibition of the Venice Biennale (Biennale Architecture) featured “otaku”. In 2005, the word _moe_ - one of the keywords of the present volume - was chosen as one of the top ten “buzzwords of the year."[29] The former Prime Minister of Japan Taro Aso has also claimed to be an _otaku_, using this subculture to promote Japan in foreign affairs.[30] In 2013, a Japanese study of 137,734 people found that 42.2% self-identify as a type of _otaku_. This study suggests that the stigma of the word has vanished, and the term has been embraced by many.[31]

Places

The district of Akihabara in Tokyo, where there are maid cafés featuring waitresses who dress up and act like maids or anime characters, is a notable attraction center for _otaku_. Akihabara also has dozens of stores specializing in anime, manga, retro video games, figurines, card games and other collectibles.[32] Another popular location is Otome Road in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. In Nagoya, students from Nagoya City University started a project on ways to help promote hidden tourist attractions related to the _otaku_ culture to attract more _otaku_ to the city.[33]

Subtypes

There are specific terms for different types of _otaku_, including , a self-mockingly pejorative Japanese term for female fans of _yaoi_, which focuses on homosexual male relationships.[34] _Reki-jo_ are female _otaku_ who are interested in Japanese history. Some terms refer to a location, such as _Akiba-kei_, a slang term meaning "Akihabara-style" which applies to those familiar with Akihabara's culture. Another is , a type of cheering that is part of Akiba-kei. Other terms, such as , literally "painful car", describe vehicles who are decorated with fictional characters, especially bishōjo game or eroge characters.[35][36]

Media

_Otaku_ often participate in self-mocking through the production or interest in humor directed at their subculture. Anime and manga _otaku_ are the subject of numerous self-critical works, such as _Otaku no Video_, which contains a live-interview mockumentary that pokes fun at the _otaku_ subculture and includes Gainax's own staff as the interviewees.[37] Other works depict _otaku_ subculture less critically, such as _Genshiken_ and _Comic Party_. A well-known novel-come-manga-come-anime is _Welcome to the N.H.K._, which focuses on the subcultures popular with _otaku_ and highlights other social outcasts such as the hikikomori and NEETs. Works that focus on an _otaku_ character include _WataMote_, the story of an unattractive and unsociable otome game _otaku_ who exhibits delusions about her social status.[38] Watamote is a self-mocking insight that follows the heroine's delusion and attempts to reform herself only by facing reality with comedic results on the path to popularity. An American documentary, _Otaku Unite!_, focuses on the American side of the _otaku_ culture.[39]


Types and classification of Japanese otaku

Of these groups, manga (Japanese comics) was the largest, with 350,000 individuals and ¥83 billion market scale. Idol _otaku_ were the next largest group, with 280,000 individuals and ¥61 billion. Travel _otaku_ with 250,000 individuals and ¥81 billion. PC _otaku_ with 190,000 individuals and ¥36 billion. Video game _otaku_ with 160,000 individuals and ¥21 billion. Automobile _otaku_ with 140,000 individuals and ¥54 billion. Animation (anime) _otaku_ with 110,000 individuals and ¥20 billion. The remaining five categories include Mobile IT equipment _otaku_, with 70,000 individuals and ¥8 billion; Audio-visual equipment _otaku_, with 60,000 individuals and ¥12 billion; camera _otaku_, with 50,000 individuals and ¥18 billion; fashion _otaku_, with 40,000 individuals and ¥13 billion; and railway _otaku_, with 20,000 individuals and ¥4 billion. Healthcare _otaku_, with 4,200 individuals primarily in the Pasco county region and 2 billion yen.[42] These values were partially released with a much higher estimation in 2004, but this definition focused on the consumerism and not the "unique psychological characteristics" of _otaku_ used in the 2005 study.[43][44]

NRI's 2005 study also put forth five archetypes of _otaku_. The first is the family-oriented _otaku_, who has broad interests and is more mature than other otaku; their object of interest is secretive and they are "closet otaku". The second is the serious "leaving my own mark on the world" _otaku_, with interests in mechanical or business personality fields. The third type is the "media-sensitive multiple interest" _otaku_, whose diverse interests are shared with others. The fourth type is the "outgoing and assertive otaku", who gain recognition by promoting their hobby. The last is the "fan magazine-obsessed otaku", which is predominately female with a small group of males being the "moe type"; the secret hobby is focused on the production or interest in fan works.[45] The Hamagin Research Institute found that moe-related content was worth ¥88.8 billion ($807 million) in 2005, and one analyst estimated the market could be as much as ¥2 trillion ($18 billion).[46] Japan-based _Tokyo Otaku Mode_, a place for news relating to _otaku_, has been liked on Facebook almost 10 million times.[47]

Other classifications of _otaku_ interests include vocaloid, cosplay, figures and professional wrestling as categorized by the Yano Research Institute. Yano Research reports and tracks market growth and trends in sectors heavily influenced by _otaku_ consumerism. In 2012, it noted around 30% growth in dating sim and online gaming _otaku_, while vocaloid, cosplay, idols and maid services grew by 10%, confirming its 2011 predictions.[48][49]
