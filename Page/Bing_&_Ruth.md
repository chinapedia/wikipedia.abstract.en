BING & RUTH is an American minimalist/ambient music[1] ensemble from Brooklyn, led by pianist David Moore.


History

Formation

In 2006, David Moore started Bing & Ruth to bring his music outside of academia. As a student at The New School for Jazz in New York City, Moore wanted to write "minimalist ensemble music with a certain filmic sensitivity, one that prioritized grace and texture over the style’s once-radical subtraction."[2] Moore named the band after two characters from the 1980 short story "Daylight Come" by Amy Hempel.[3]

_City Lake_ (2010) and _Tomorrow Was The Golden Age_ (2014)

Bing & Ruth's first album, _City Lake_, was self-released in 2010 in a run of 250 physical copies. The ensemble featured eleven members, making touring and rehearsals difficult to coordinate.[4]

While facing financial and logistical issues associated with selling self-released vinyl out of his basement, Moore was put in touch with experimental label RVNG Intl. In 2014, Bing & Ruth signed with the label RVNG Intl. and issued _Tomorrow Was the Golden Age_;[5] the following year, they reissued _City Lake_ in a larger print run.[6]

_Tomorrow Was The Golden Age_ saw the group pare down to a seven-person ensemble composed of a pianist, two clarinetists, two bassists, a cellist and a tape-delay operator.[7] The group sought to "revive[] interest in the meditative pop traditions of Philip Glass and Harold Budd."[8] Pitchfork called it, "one of the finest left-field releases of the year"[9] and included it on their list of the "Top 50 Ambient Albums of All Time" in 2016.[10]

_No Home of the Mind_ (2017)

In 2016, Bing & Ruth signed with 4AD and announced the release of their new album _No Home of the Mind_ in February 2017.[11]

_No Home of the Mind_ was written on seventeen pianos across North America and Europe over numerous sessions, tours, and travel and recorded in Hudson, NY in 2016.[12] The self-contained pieces were arranged for a five-person ensemble. The album was recorded in two days at a repurposed church in Hudson, NY in the fewest takes possible in order to "capture the immediacy of classic session-style musicianship, where one-take recordings were a standard to keep costs down."[13]
