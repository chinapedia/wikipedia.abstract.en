HIDDEN TEAR is the first open-source ransomware trojan that targets computers running Microsoft Windows[1] The original sample was posted in August of 2015 to GitHub.[2]

When Hidden Tear is activated, it encrypts certain types of files using a symmetric AES algorithm, then sends the symmetric key to the malware's control servers.[3] However, as Utku Sen claimed "All my malware codes are backdoored on purpose", Hidden Tear has an encryption backdoor, thus allowing him to crack various samples.[4]
