VANJESS is a Nigerian-American R&B duo composed of sisters Ivana and Jessica Nwokike. The duo began their career on YouTube performing cover songs. After one of their videos, a cover of Drake's "Headlines", had viral success, they decided to pursue a serious career in music.[1] In 2011 the duo hired a manager and recorded in a studio for the first time.[2] On November 12, 2018 the group announced that they had signed to the RCA joint venture label Keep Cool.[3]


History

The sisters are first generation Nigerian immigrants of Igbo origin,[4] although they were both born in the United States.[5] According to Jessica, they spent 'about eight or nine years' of their childhood in Nigeria, before moving to La Palma, California with their mother, when they were 10 and 8 years old, respectively. They later moved to Cerritos.[6] They attended a performing arts elementary school. In middle school and high school they performed as a duo in talent shows. [7]

They have supported causes like the "Louder than Words" campaign in 2012 and performed at 2013's "Lights Camera Cure" dance-a-thon. They have made appearances on shows like VH1's "The Linda Perry Project".[8] The duo re-released their debut EP _00 till Escape_ in 2015 which charted in the iTunes top ten and trended worldwide. Their debut album _Silk Canvas,_ an album of original material, was released in 2018. The duo released five singles from the album: "Adore", "Touch the Floor", "Through Enough", "Addicted", "Easy", and "Control Me". The album includes collaborations with Masego, GoldLink, Lil Simz, Leikeli47, and Berhana.

The duo have listed Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Xscape, TLC, and SWV as their biggest musical influences.[9]
