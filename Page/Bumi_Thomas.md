Personal life

Thomas resides in London. She has said of her heritage: "My experience in Nigeria as a woman of Yoruba and Igbo heritage living in Hausaland has shaped me. Though I still retain aspects of my British experiences of early childhood; I had a thick Glaswegian accent when we moved to Kano and still retain the Scottish attitude about being less uptight about life."[4]
