History

The Geelong-Ballarat railway line passed through Yendon, and for a while in the early 1860s it was the terminus of the line. A substantial two-storied bluestone railway station was built in 1862. This was demolished in 1969.[3] The stone from the railway station was reused to build garden retaining walls at the Ballarat Institute of Advanced Education (now Federation University).[4]

Yendon's first school, the Common School opened in 1864, which in 1879 became Yendon State School and closed at the end of 1993.[5][6]
