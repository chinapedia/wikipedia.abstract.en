Personal

After avoiding jail time and receiving three years probation for gun and narcotics charge as a juvenile,[10] Booker took up training in Stamford, Connecticut under former light heavyweight pro Ahmed Mickens at Revolution Training and Fitness, where he also works as a personal trainer.


"The Boxer" Documentary

Booker will be the subject of a documentary short that will premiere in November 2016 at three film festivals: DOC NYC, the Big Apple Film Festival, and New York Short Film Festival.[11][12][13] The film is directed by Craig Cutler and produced by Fela Cortes.[14][15]

DOC NYC description reads:

  _The Boxer is an intimate portrait of Chordale Booker, a gifted USA boxer and National Champion with a storied past. Following a court ruling that afforded Chordale a second chance at life, he vowed to make right and fight his battles in the place he knew best, the ring. Follow his tumultuous journey through the lens of director and photographer, Craig Cutler._

The film was awarded the Big Apple Film Festival's Best Short Documentary.[16]


Trainer

Between fights, Booker works as a personal trainer at Revolution Training in Stamford, CT.[17] Additionally, he coaches Golden Gloves fighters Jacqueline Boyle (132) and Catie Ramsey (125), as well as MMA fighter Kastriot Xhema.


Acting and Modeling

Booker appeared in a 2017 MSNBC commercial for Hardball with Chris Matthews with the host.[18] He made his modeling debut along with former WWE Diva Summer Rae at the September 2018 New York Fashion Week runway show for designer ACID NYC.[19] In 2019 he starred in a commercial and was featured in print advertising for SentinelOne.[20]


Go The Distance Foundation

In November 2018, Booker launched the "Go The Distance Foundation" at Trailblazers Academy in Stamford. Booker said: “The No. 1 thing I want to do is break down the barriers between at-risk youth and the police. I don’t want our kids to think they can’t have a conversation with a police officer. I want to create a place with an atmosphere where we can create a dialog and conversation with both points of view."[21]
