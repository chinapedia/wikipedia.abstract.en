Sometimes followed by another word, such as Poster or Posting, an ILLEGAL HANDBILL is one that violates laws or codes regarding use of a public place to advertise.

A handbill includes any sign, notice, placard, poster, paper, advertising circular, sticker, card, leaflet, or other similar item calculated to attract the attention of the public. [1]


Examples of Restrictions

Although the precise wording may vary from place to place, an example of applicable regulations is:

-   "No person shall post, affix, ... attach ... upon any street lamp, street sign, ... utility poll ... [2]


Enforcement

-   Fines [3][4]
-   Combatting posters for upcoming events by marking them CANCELLED [5]
-   have government workers tear them down [6] [7] [8]
-   Business loss [9]


Legal alternative

-   Permitting posting on a limited basis, e.g. bulletin boards [10] provides another outlet for the distribution of the information.
