Play-off stages

In order to determine the order of draws during the play-offs stages, the following criteria is used:[1]

-   Group winners are placed in spots 1, 2 and 3, depending on their results in the group stage.
-   Group runners-up are placed in spots 4, 5 and 6, depending on their results in the group stage.
-   The two best third-placed teams are placed in spots 7 and 8, depending on their results in the group stage.
-   The worst third-placed team and the fourth and fifth-placed teams failed to qualify to quarterfinals and, therefore, are forced to play and alternate play-off to determine places 9th to 13th.

Also, the following changes are made to the group stage for ordering purposes:

-   For the teams in Group A, all results involved the fifth-placed team (Egypt) will be not counted, in order to calculate results in a 4-team group.
-   All victories (if necessary) are reduced to only 6 goals of difference, in order to prevent scoring lots of goals against weaker teams for opting to better spots in play-offs.
