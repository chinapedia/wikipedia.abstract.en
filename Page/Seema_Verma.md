SEEMA VERMA (September 27, 1970)[1] is an American health policy consultant and the current Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, serving in the Trump Administration.[2] She is the founder and previous CEO of SVC Inc., a health policy consulting firm, now known as Health Management Associates (HMA).


Education

Verma received her bachelor's degree in life sciences from the University of Maryland, College Park in 1993. She earned a master's degree in public health with a concentration in health policy and management from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in 1996.[3] A graduate of the Richard G. Lugar Excellence in Public Service Series, she was also selected for the American Enterprise Institute's Leadership Network.[4]


Career

Early career

Verma worked for the Health & Hospital Corporation of Marion County as vice president of planning[5] and at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials in Washington, DC.[6]

SVC Inc.

Verma founded the health policy consulting firm SVC Inc. in June 2001. She is president and CEO of the company, which has worked with state insurance agencies and public health agencies in preparation for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), and assisted Indiana and Kentucky, as well as other states, in the design of Medicaid expansion programs under the ACA.[7] In her work with Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky she developed Medicaid reform programs with the use of the Section 1115 waiver process.[8][9] The 1115 waiver, which needs to be approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), allows states to pursue customized programs that diverge from the standard program under ACA statutory guidelines. In the case of Ohio, the program ultimately was not implemented, because the CMS denied the state's 1115 waiver application;[10][11] Kentucky's application was still pending as of April 2017.[12][13] Verma's firm also provided technical assistance to the state of Michigan in the implementation of their 1115 Medicaid waiver, assisted Tennessee in their coverage expansion proposal, and supported Iowa's Medicaid transition to managed care.[14] Verma and SVC have worked with companies such as Electronic Data Systems (EDS), Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HP), Milliman, HighPoint Global, Roche Diagnostics, Health Management Associates (HMA), and Maximus.[15]

Verma established her reputation with her work on Indiana's redesigned Medicaid program.[16] She first worked with Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels on health care policy,[17] and was the architect of the health insurance pilot program known as the "Healthy Indiana Plan",[18] which received support from the Indiana legislature and passed into law in January 2008.[19] Designed for people with low income, the plan requires participants to pay into a health savings account and has high deductibles.[20] According to Verma, "you have to make your contribution every month, with a 60-day grace period. If you don't make the contribution, you're out of the program for 12 months. It's a strong personal responsibility mechanism."[21] Later, following the passage of the Affordable Care Act, in 2010, she worked with Daniels, and then his successor, Governor Mike Pence,[22] in creating the related "Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0", an alternative Medicaid expansion that utilizes the 1115 waiver.[23]

Seema_Verma_official_Transition_portrait.jpg In 2014, an article in _The Indianapolis Star_ raised concerns over a potential conflict of interest arising from Verma's dual roles as both a health care consultant for Indiana and an employee of a Hewlett-Packard division that is among Indiana's largest Medicaid vendors.[24] , SVC Inc. had been awarded over $3.5 million in Indiana state contracts. Verma was concurrently employed with Hewlett-Packard, earning over $1 million during a period when the company had secured $500 million in state contracts.[25]

Verma was a participant in the Republican Governor's Public Policy Committee on Medicaid reform.[26] She contributed to the report _A New Medicaid: A Flexible, Innovative and Accountable Future._ Verma has also presented to the Medicaid Task Force of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and provided testimony before the U.S. House Energy Subcommittee on Health.[27]

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services

On November 29, 2016, President-elect Donald Trump nominated Verma to serve as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Health Department agency that oversees Medicare, Medicaid, and the insurance markets.[28] On March 13, 2017, the United States Senate confirmed her nomination in a 55–43 vote.[29] One of her first actions was to send a letter to the nation's governors urging them to impose insurance premiums for Medicaid, charge Medicaid recipients for emergency room visits, and encourage recipients to get jobs or job training.[30]


Personal life

Born in Virginia, Verma moved several times across the United States with her family and once lived in Taiwan for five years before settling in the greater Indianapolis area.[31] Verma's husband, Sanjay, is a child psychiatrist who runs a medical practice through the Indiana Health Group.[32][33] The couple have two children – Maya and Shaan.[34] Verma and her family currently live in Carmel, Indiana.[35]
