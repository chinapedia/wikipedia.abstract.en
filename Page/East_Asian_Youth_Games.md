The EAST ASIAN YOUTH GAMES (EAYG) is an international multi-sport event organised by the East Asian Olympic Committee (EAOC) and held every four years since 2019 among athletes from East Asian countries and territories of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA), as well as the Pacific island of Guam, which is a member of the Oceania National Olympic Committees.

The East Asian Youth Games is one of the five regional games of the OCA. The other four are the Central Asian Games, the South Asian Games, the Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games), and the West Asian Games.[1]


History

On July 24, 2018, the East Asian Olympic Committee (EAOC) held an impromptu meeting at the request of People's Republic of China (PRC) to revoke the hosting rights of Taichung in Taiwan,[2] citing recent referendum movement in Taiwan to change its name from "Chinese Taipei" to "Taiwan" for 2020 Summer Olympics. The vote against Taichung passed 6 against 1 with PRC, Hong Kong, Macau, Mongolia, North Korea and South Korea voted against Taichung, Taiwan voted for Taichung and Japan abstaining.[3] The move by PRC is considered by Taiwan as politically motivated and is part of recent PRC government aggressive schemes to massively diminish the presence of Taiwan on the international arena.[4]
