SILVERTON is an historic town in Douglas County, Missouri, United States. The GNIS classifies it as a populated place.[1] It was located along County Road 317 on Spring Creek, north-northeast of Wasola and west of the Hilo Cemetery, along Route N on Hilo Ridge.[2][3] Although _Hilo_ is listed as a variant name, the two were not at the same location.[4]

A post office called Silverton was established in 1889, and remained in operation until 1933.[5]
