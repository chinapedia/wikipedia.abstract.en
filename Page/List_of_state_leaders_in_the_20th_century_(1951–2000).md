State leaders: 1901–1950 – State leaders in the 21st century – State leaders by year

This is a LIST OF STATE LEADERS IN THE 20TH CENTURY (1951–2000) AD, such as the heads of state, heads of government, and the general secretaries of single-party states.

These polities are generally sovereign states, including states with limited recognition (when recognised by at least one UN member state), but excludes _minor_ dependent territories, whose leaders can be found listed under territorial governors in the 20th century. For completeness, these lists can include colonies, protectorates, or other dependent territories that have since gained sovereignty.
