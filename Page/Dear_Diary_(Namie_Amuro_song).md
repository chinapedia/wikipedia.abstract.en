"DEAR DIARY" is a song by Japanese recording artist Namie Amuro, released as a double A-side single with her track "Fighter". It was released on October 26, 2016 via Dimension Point and Avex Trax as Amuro's seventh consecutive non-album single, and is the theme song to the Japanese drama–horror film, _Death Note: Light Up the New World_ (2016). It was distributed with "Dear Diary" in two physical formats—standard CD and CD/DVD bundle. "Dear Diary" was written, composed and produced by Matthew Tishler, Felicia Barton, Aaron Benward, and frequent collaborator Tiger. Musically, the recording is a pop ballad that lyrically focuses on the films title and recurring theme; furthermore, it delves into themes of empowerment and rising from pain and sorrow.

Commercially, both recordings experienced success in Japan, peaking at number three on the daily and weekly Oricon Singles Chart and on component _Billboard_ charts in that region.

In order to promote the track, "Dear Diary" was broadcast on several Japanese television shows and was included on the singers 2016–17 Live Style tour in Japan.

-   -   and "Hero" (July 2016),Released on July 27, 2016;

-   -   with the latter being used as the official theme song to the NHK broadcasting of the Summer Olympics and Paralympics.[2] In August, Amuro confirmed her involvement with the Japanese drama–horror film, _Death Note: Light Up the New World_, based on the anime and manga series of the same name.[3] Originally, Takahiro Sato, the films co-producer, wanted to enlist Western musicians to provide songs to the movie, which he used Red Hot Chili Peppers or Lenny Kravitz as examples. However, knowing that the series was already popular around the globe, Sato decided to enlist Amuro in order to get the audience to recognized the "power of foreign artists" and also promote her work overseas.[4] Amuro herself expressed her gratitude for participating in the film's soundtrack.[5]

The singer revealed the titles to be "Dear Diary" and "Fighter", which were served as double A-side singles; this is her first to do so since 2014's "Big Boys Cry/Beautiful".[6]Released on March 6, 2013;

-   -   The former track was allocated as the film's theme song, whilst "Fighter" was used as the insert track—a term used in Japan for a recording placed randomly throughout the film.[7] Additionally, "Fighter" served as the theme tune for the film's spin-off series, _Death Note: New Generation_, which premiered on streaming service Hulu.[8]

"Dear Diary" was written, composed and produced by Matthew Tishler, Felicia Barton, Aaron Benward, and frequent collaborator Tiger.[9] Furthermore, Emyli provided background vocals to both this track and "Dear Diary".

Music video

An accompanying music video was directed by Ryouhei Shingu, whom previously worked with Amuro on her July 2016 single "Hero".[44] It opens with a diary and quill on a desk, with the pages being blown by a gust of wind. The scene turns black and changes to Amuro on a beach front, before dawn, surrounded by large drift wood with lanterns. Several intercepting shots include the beach waves going towards shore and Amuro singing the track. By the first chorus, a distance shot of the ocean features glass bottles that are housing several homes, people and fauna. As the song progresses, the sun starts to rise, and various angles of the people inside the bottles express their sadness. As the final chorus opens, the bottle tops melt away and burst out a large rift of water below a newly-risen sun and multi-colored clouds. The visual ends with Amuro gazing in the distance, and turning to the camera.[45] A promotional teaser of the video, alongside a snippet of "Fighter", was uploaded on Amuro's YouTube channel.[46]
