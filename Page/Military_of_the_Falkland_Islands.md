The FALKLAND ISLANDS are a British overseas territory and, as such, rely on the UK for the guarantee of their security. The other UK territories in the South Atlantic, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, fall under the protection of BRITISH FORCES SOUTH ATLANTIC ISLANDS (BFSAI), formerly known as BRITISH FORCES FALKLAND ISLANDS (BFFI), which includes commitments from the British Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy.[1] They are headed by the Commander of the British Forces South Atlantic Islands (CBFSAI).[2]

Argentina invaded and took control of the Falklands on 2 April 1982. After recapturing the territory in June 1982, the UK invested heavily in the defence of the islands, the centrepiece of which was a new airfield at RAF Mount Pleasant, west of Stanley.[3] The base was opened in 1985, and became fully operational in 1986.[4]


Falkland Islands Defence Force

The Falkland Islands maintains its own part-time volunteer force, the Falkland Islands Defence Force (FIDF), previously known as the Falkland Islands Volunteer Corps. Although this unit existed in 1982 as a reinforcement for the Governor's detachment of Royal Marines, it did not play any part in the main conflict during the war of 1982, its members having spent the duration of the hostilities under house arrest by the Argentines after their surrender on the Argentine capture of the islands.[5][6][7] The FIDF is now a company-strength light infantry force with a permanent training Warrant Officer seconded from the Royal Marines. The FIDF operates in a number of roles and is fully integrated into the defence scheme for the islands. The FIDF has been trained by the Royal Navy to operate Oerlikon 20 mm cannon and to board vessels suspected of fishery poaching.[8]


Royal Navy

RAF Mount Pleasant has its own port facility[9] called Mare Harbour, operated by Naval Party 2010 (NP2010). The Royal Navy maintains a presence in the area with a frigate or guided missile destroyer accompanied by an RFA vessel in the South Atlantic and a patrol ship, currently HMS _Clyde_, permanently close to the islands.[10] In addition, an Ice Patrol Ship, , is on station close to Antarctica for six months of the year.[11]

The warship and RFA vessel carry out the Atlantic Patrol Task (South) mission, which "provides a maritime presence to protect the UK's interests in the region". The Type 42 destroyer HMS _Edinburgh_ took over the South Atlantic Patrol Task in October 2006,[12] replacing HMS _Southampton_. Prior to _Southampton's_ deployment in August 2005, the role was filled by HMS _Cardiff_, which was decommissioned on return to the UK. As of February 2010, the on-station warship was the Type 42 destroyer HMS _York_. In late April 2010, HMS York was relieved by the Type 23 frigate HMS _Portland_. In August 2010, HMS Portland was relieved by the Type 42 destroyer HMS _Gloucester_. On 21 April 2011, HMS _York_ arrived at the East Cove Military Port in the Falkland Islands, beginning patrol duties for the islands.[13] October 2011 saw the arrival of the Type 23 frigate HMS _Montrose_, generating a statement from UNASUR (Union of South American Nations). The Type 45 guided missile destroyer HMS _Dauntless_ replaced HMS Montrose as of April 2012. [14] In early August 2013, HMS Richmond was deployed to be the ship for the Royal Navy's Atlantic Patrol.[15] HMS Portland was again deployed in January 2014.

The Falkland Islands Patrol ship is a River-class patrol vessel, which replaced the previous Castle-class patrol vessel. In 2007, HMS _Clyde_ relieved HMS _Dumbarton Castle_ and HMS _Leeds Castle_. It is planned to be replaced by HMS Forth in 2018.[16][17]

The Royal Navy also has _Trafalgar_ and _Astute_-class nuclear submarines that it can deploy to the area, though such deployments are classified. The threat from submarines to hostile ships was demonstrated during the Falklands War when HMS _Conqueror_ sank the Argentine cruiser ARA _General Belgrano_. The Royal Navy's submarines also carry BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles, which have a range of and can strike at targets within an enemy country. _The Sun_ newspaper has speculated that a _Swiftsure_-class attack submarine, HMS _Sceptre_, was sent to the islands in March 2010.[18] In February 2012, a _Trafalgar_-class nuclear submarine may have been deployed to the Falkland Islands.[19][20]


British Army

Soldiers_Load_a_Rapier_Missile_System_During_London_Olympics_Security_Exercise.jpg system.]] The British Army maintains a garrison on the Falkland Islands based at Mount Pleasant. The total deployment is about 1,200 personnel made up of a _roulement_ infantry company, an engineer squadron, a signals unit (part of the Joint Communications Unit – see below), a logistics group and supporting services.[21][22][23]

The British Army contributes to the Joint Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal group (see below) in the Falkland Islands, providing 33 Engineer Regiment (EOD) and RLC EOD teams.[24] This has been reduced to a team of 11 personnel.[25]


Royal Air Force

RAF Mount Pleasant was built in 1985 with the capability of accepting large trans-Atlantic aircraft such as the Lockheed TriStar. The TriStar was purchased mainly for the UK-Falklands route; until their entry into service, the UK used leased 747s and 767s.[26]

Originally Lockheed Hercules C.1K were used for air-to-air refuelling missions, but these were later replaced by a VC10. On 31 August 2013 the VC10 was replaced by a TriStar K.1 which was itself replaced by a Voyager KC.2 in February 2014. When a fighter is launched, it is almost immediately followed by the tanker as changeable weather conditions might make diversion to another airfield necessary. The Voyager however will be unable to fit within a hangar at RAF Mount Pleasant.[27]

Four Typhoon aircraft provide air defence for the islands and surrounding territories and have a secondary ground attack role.

The helicopters of No. 1564 Flight (formerly No. 78 Squadron) provided air transport missions. The Sea Kings carried out short and medium range search and rescue missions, until their retirement. AAR Corp was awarded a contract for helicopter search and rescue services in the Falkland Islands to replace 1564 Flight, using AgustaWestland AW189 helicopters in the role from 2016.[28] In March 2015, the UK announced that a pair of Chinooks would be stationed in the Falklands again, the first of which started flying in June 2016.[29][30] 1564 Flight disbanded in March 2016.[31]

A C-130 Hercules was used for transport, search and rescue and maritime patrol until replaced with an A400M Atlas C1 in April 2018.

Joint Service

The Joint Communications Unit Falkland Islands (JCUFI) provides the electronic warfare and command and control systems for the Royal Navy, Army and RAF stationed there. It incorporates the Army's signals unit and RAF personnel.[36]

Joint Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal in the Falkland Islands consists of 33 Engineer Regiment (EOD), RAF and RLC EOD teams. It is mainly based in Stanley, but there is also a detachment at Mount Pleasant. The groups operates the Joint Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal Operations Centre. The group destroys munitions from the Falklands War that did not explode at the time and briefs troops, tourists and citizens on the areas that are safe and the minefield markings that have been put in place.[37][38]


Augmentation forces

The UK maintains a Joint Rapid Reaction Force, which contains elements of all three services, that could be deployed to the islands in the event of receiving intelligence of a specific threat to the islands.
