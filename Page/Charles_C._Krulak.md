Legacy

Krulak famously referred to the "Strategic Corporal" and the Three Block War as two of the key lessons identified from the deployments in Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia. These concepts are still considered vital in understanding the increasing complexity of modern battlefields.

Krulak explained some of his warfighting philosophy in an interview with Tom Clancy in Clancy's nonfiction book _Marine_. Clancy referred to Krulak as "Warrior Prince of the Corps." Krulak also rewrote the Marine Corps' basic combat study text, _MCDP 1: Warfighting_, incorporating his theories on operations in the modern battlefield.


Family

Krulak is married to Zandi Meyers from Annapolis. They have two sons: CAPT. David C. Krulak, the current Executive Officer for Naval Hospital Yokosuka, Japan[11] and Todd, a retired freelance rave DJ who is now a professor at Samford University; and five grandchildren: 2ndLT Brian Krulak, Katie, Mary, Matthew and Charles. He is the son of Lieutenant General Victor H. Krulak, Sr., and the younger brother of Commander Victor H. Krulak Jr, Navy Chaplain Corps and Colonel William Krulak, United States Marine Corps Reserve.[12] Krulak's godfather was USMC general Holland McTyeire "Howlin' Mad" Smith.[13]
