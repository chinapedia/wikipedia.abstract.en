_META_ is the third album by the American band Car Bomb. The album was produced by Gojira's Joseph Duplantier and guitarist Greg Kubacki, and was released independently on digital and CD formats on 28 October 2016.

In September, the band released five second fragments of the song "From the Dust of This Planet" through music sharing for fans to assemble in any order to form a complete song.

The album features guest vocals from Joe Duplantier on "The Oppressor", and Suffocation's Frank Mullen on "Sets".

Tracks "From the Dust of This Planet", "Sets", and "Gratitude" were released as previews and "Black Blood" as a video.

The album was praised in reviews for its originality and how "paralyzing and oppressively heavy" it is,[1] svbterranean.net stating "_Meta_ is the band’s heaviest, forward-thinking and out there moments in their discography."[2] Axl Rosenberg of MetalSucks praised the album, writing, "My mind is too blown by this record."
