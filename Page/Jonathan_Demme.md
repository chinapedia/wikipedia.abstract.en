ROBERT JONATHAN DEMME ( ;[1] February 22, 1944 – April 26, 2017) was an American director, producer, and screenwriter. He is best known for directing the psychological horror _The Silence of the Lambs_ (1991), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Director. He also directed _Melvin and Howard_ (1980), _Swing Shift_ (1984), _Something Wild_ (1986), _Married to the Mob_ (1988), the concert film _Stop Making Sense_ (1984), _Philadelphia_ (1993) and _Rachel Getting Married_ (2008).


Early life

Demme was born on February 22, 1944 in Baldwin, New York, the son of Dorothy Louise (_née_ Rogers)[2] and Robert Eugene Demme, a public relations executive.[3][4] He was raised in Rockville Centre, New York and Miami,[5] where he graduated from Southwest Miami High School[6] before attending the University of Florida.[7]


Career

Early films

Demme broke into feature film working for exploitation film producer Roger Corman early in his career, co-writing and producing _Angels Hard as They Come_ (1971), a motorcycle movie very loosely based on _Rashomon_,[8] and _The Hot Box_ (1972). He then moved on to directing three films for Corman's studio New World Pictures: _Caged Heat_ (1974), _Crazy Mama_ (1975), and _Fighting Mad_ (1976). After _Fighting Mad_, Demme directed the comedy film _Handle with Care_ (originally titled _Citizens Band_, 1977) for Paramount Pictures. The film was well received by critics,[9] but received little promotion,[10] and performed poorly at the box office.[11]

Demme's next film, _Melvin and Howard_ (1980), did not get a wide release, but received a groundswell of critical acclaim, and led to the signing of Demme to direct the Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell star vehicle _Swing Shift_ (1984). Intended as a prestige picture for Warner Bros.[12] as well as a major commercial vehicle for Demme,[13] it instead became a troubled production due to the conflicting visions of Demme and star Hawn. Demme ended up renouncing the finished product, and when the film was released in May 1984, it was generally panned by critics and neglected by moviegoers.[14] After _Swing Shift_, Demme stepped back from Hollywood to make the Talking Heads concert film _Stop Making Sense_ (also 1984) which won the National Society of Film Critics Award for best documentary;[15] the eclectic screwball action-romantic comedy _Something Wild_ (1986); a film-version of the stage production _Swimming to Cambodia_ (1987), by monologist Spalding Gray; and the New York Mafia-by-way-of Downtown comedy _Married to the Mob_ (1988).

Demme formed his production company, Clinica Estetico, with producers Edward Saxon and Peter Saraf in 1987.[16][17] They were based out of New York City for fifteen years.[18][19]

Later films

Demme won the Academy Award for _The Silence of the Lambs_ (1991)—one of only three films to win all the major categories (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Actress).[20] Inspired by his friend Juan Suárez Botas's illness with AIDS[21] and fueled by his own moral convictions,[22] Demme then used his influence to make _Philadelphia_ (1993),[23] one of the first major films to address the AIDS crisis[24] and which garnered star Tom Hanks his first Best Actor Oscar.[25] He also co-directed (with his nephew Ted) the music video for Bruce Springsteen's Best Song Oscar-winning "Streets of Philadelphia" from the film's soundtrack.[26]

Subsequently, his films included an adaptation of Toni Morrison's _Beloved_ (1998), and remakes of two films from the 1960s: _The Truth About Charlie_ (2002), based on _Charade,_ that starred Mark Wahlberg in the Cary Grant role; and _The Manchurian Candidate_ (2004), with Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep. Demme's documentary film _Man from Plains_ (2007), a documentary about former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's promotional tour publicizing his book _Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid_, had its premiere at the Venice Film Festival and Toronto International Film Festival.

His art-house hit _Rachel Getting Married_ (2008) was compared by many critics to Demme's films of the late 1970s and 1980s.[27][28][29] It was included in many 2008 "best of" lists, and received numerous awards and nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress by lead Anne Hathaway. In 2010, Demme made his first foray into theater, directing _Family Week_, a play by Beth Henley. The play was produced by MCC Theater and co-starred Rosemarie DeWitt and Kathleen Chalfant.[30]

At one time, Demme was signed on to direct, produce, and write an adaptation of Stephen King's sci-fi novel _11/22/63_, but later left due to disagreements with King on what should be included in the script.[31]

He returned to the concert documentary format with _Justin Timberlake + the Tennessee Kids_ (2016), which he described as a "performance film, but also a portrait of an artist at a certain moment in the arc of his career",[32] and his last project was a history of rock & roll for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame compiled from footage from Hall of Fame induction ceremonies set to debut in summer 2017.[33]

Demme directed music videos for artists such as Suburban Lawns, New Order, KRS-One's H.E.A.L. project and Bruce Springsteen. He also produced a compilation of Haitian music called _Konbit: Burning Rhythms of Haiti_ that was released in 1989. (Lou Reed selected _Konbit..._ as one of his 'picks of 1989').[34]

Demme was on the board of directors at Jacob Burns Film Center in Pleasantville, New York. In addition to his role on the board, he curated and hosted a monthly series called "Rarely Seen Cinema".[35]


Style

Throughout 1986–2004, Demme was known for his dramatic close-ups in films. This style of close-ups involves the character looking directly into the camera during crucial moments, particularly in the "Quid pro quo" scene in _Silence of the Lambs_. According to Demme, this was done to put the viewer into the character's shoes. Beginning with _Rachel Getting Married_ (2008), Demme adopted a documentary style of filmmaking.[36][37]

Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson has paid homage to Demme in his films and has cited him as a major influence in his work. In an interview, Anderson jokingly stated that the three filmmakers who inspired him the most are "Jonathan Demme, Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Demme."[38][39] Other directors such as Alexander Payne and Wes Anderson have been known to copy his close-ups in their own work.[40][41]


Political activism

Demme was involved in various political projects. In 1981, he directed a series of commercials for the liberal advocacy group People for the American Way. The spots, titled "Eggs",[42] "Music",[43][44] and "Sports",[45] were produced by Norman Lear and featured Muhammad Ali, Carol Burnett, and Goldie Hawn celebrating Freedom of Expression.[46] In 1985, he directed a video for Artists United Against Apartheid. The short, featured various international musicians including Afrika Bambaataa, Rubén Blades, Jimmy Cliff, Herbie Hancock, Little Steven, Run–D.M.C., and Bruce Springsteen, calling for a boycott of the South African luxury resort Sun City during Apartheid. His documentary _Haiti Dreams of Democracy_ (1988) captured Haiti's era of democratic rebuilding after dictatorship, while his documentary _The Agronomist_ (2008) profiled Haitian journalist and human rights activist Jean Dominique. Demme spent six years on the documentary _I'm Carolyn Parker_ (2011), which highlighted rebuilding efforts in New Orleans Lower Ninth Ward after Hurricane Katrina.


Personal life

Demme was married twice, first to Evelyn Purcell and then Joanne Howard, with whom he had three children: Ramona, Brooklyn, and Jos.[47] He was the uncle of film director Ted Demme, who died in 2002.[48] Demme's cousin was the Rev. Robert Wilkinson Castle Jr., an Episcopal priest who appeared in some of Demme's films.

Demme was a member of the steering committee of the Friends of the Apollo Theater, Oberlin, Ohio, along with Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman.[49] In 2013, he returned to Oberlin as part of an alumni reunion during the class of 2013 graduation ceremony and received the award for Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts.[50]

Demme was an avid collector and devotee of Haitian art; in particular of Hector Hyppolite; so much so that he called it "an addiction". In 2014, he held an auction in Philadelphia selling thousands from his collection, much of which was donated to a cultural center in Port-au-Prince.[51]


Death

On the morning of April 26, 2017, Demme died at the age of 73 in Manhattan, New York due to complications from esophageal cancer and heart disease.[52][53]

Director Brady Corbet dedicated his 2018 film, _Vox Lux_ to Demme's memory,[54] as well as Luca Guadagnino with his 2018 film _Suspiria_.
