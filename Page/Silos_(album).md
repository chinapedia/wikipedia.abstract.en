Critical reception

Christopher Bohlsen from the _Renowned for Sound_ gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 saying; "Sara Storer has a particular authenticity not too often seen in contemporary Australian country music. As many successful artists seem more Americanised, and more pop-influenced, Storer makes defiantly old-fashioned, deeply Australian music, rough edges and all. It’s when she leans into these edges that her music is at its best." adding "The best track on the record is "The Ghost", with Storer shelving her wistfulness and replacing it with a menacing swagger. Surrounded by plucked banjos and sweeping strings, she sings “I’ll make you suffer like a real man should”, and the sentiment lends her a much needed edge that isn’t apparent until this track." Bohlsen also complemented the track "It Don't Mean Jack" calling it 'stunning' concluding, "Storer’s ability to write a powerful song is inarguable, and whilst it’s unfortunate that all of Silos can’t be held up to its high standard, it still shows what a talented artist she is."
