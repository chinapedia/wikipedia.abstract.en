VOSS CREEK is a stream in Franklin County in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] It is a tributary of the Bourbeuse River.

The headwaters arise just east of Missouri Route EE (at [2]) and it flows to the east-southeast passing south of the community of Neier to its confluence with the Bourbeuse about three miles east of its source (at [3]). The confluence with the Bourbeuse is about five miles southwest of Union and five miles west-northwest of St. Clair.[4]

Voss Creek most likely was named after Dietrich Voss, the proprietor of a local mill.[5]
