BERNARDO DI STEFANO ROSSELLI (active 1460- 1526) was an Italian painter, mainly active in Florence.

He was likely a young teen, when along with his cousin, Cosimo Roselli, he entered the studio of Neri di Bicci in Florence. Between 1488 to 1499, he works in decorating the Sala dei Signori in Palazzo Vecchio of Florence. In 1499 he was paid for an altarpiece destined for the Rucellai altar in San Pancrazio. Based on his predilection for more archaic representations, he putatively traveled to Rome.[1] He painted a _Madonna della Cintola with Saints_ (1484) now in the Princeton University Art Museum.[2]
