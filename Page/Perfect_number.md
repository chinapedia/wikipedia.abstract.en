Perfect_number_Cuisenaire_rods_6.png

In number theory, a PERFECT NUMBER is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.

The sum of divisors of a number, excluding the number itself, is called its aliquot sum, so a perfect number is one that is equal to its aliquot sum. Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors including itself i.e. _σ_₁(_n_) = 2_n_. For instance, 28 is perfect as 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 + 28 = 56 = 2 × 28.

This definition is ancient, appearing as early as Euclid's Elements (VII.22) where it is called (_perfect_, _ideal_, or _complete number_). Euclid also proved a formation rule (IX.36) whereby q(q + 1)/2 is an even perfect number whenever q is a prime of the form 2^(p) − 1 for prime p—what is now called a Mersenne prime. Two millennia later, Euler proved that all even perfect numbers are of this form.[1] This is known as the Euclid–Euler theorem.

It is not known whether there are any odd perfect numbers, nor whether infinitely many perfect numbers exist. The first few perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496 and 8128 .


History

In about 300 BC Euclid showed that if 2^(_p_) − 1 is prime then 2^(_p_−1)(2^(_p_) − 1) is perfect. The first four perfect numbers were the only ones known to early Greek mathematics, and the mathematician Nicomachus had noted 8128 as early as 100 AD.[2] Philo of Alexandria in his first-century book "On the creation" mentions perfect numbers, claiming that the world was created in 6 days and the moon orbits in 28 days because 6 and 28 are perfect. Philo is followed by Origen,[3] and by Didymus the Blind, who adds the observation that there are only four perfect numbers that are less than 10,000. (Commentary on Genesis 1. 14-19).[4] St Augustine defines perfect numbers in City of God (Part XI, Chapter 30) in the early 5th century AD, repeating the claim that God created the world in 6 days because 6 is the smallest perfect number. The Egyptian mathematician Ismail ibn Fallūs (1194–1252) mentioned the next three perfect numbers (33,550,336; 8,589,869,056; and 137,438,691,328) and listed a few more which are now known to be incorrect.[5] In a manuscript written between 1456 and 1461, an unknown mathematician recorded the earliest European reference to a fifth perfect number, with 33,550,336 being correctly identified for the first time.[6][7] In 1588, the Italian mathematician Pietro Cataldi also identified the sixth (8,589,869,056) and the seventh (137,438,691,328) perfect numbers, and also proved that every perfect number obtained from Euclid's rule ends with a 6 or an 8.[8][9][10]


Even perfect numbers

Euclid proved that 2^(_p_−1)(2^(_p_) − 1) is an even perfect number whenever 2^(_p_) − 1 is prime (Elements, Prop. IX.36).

For example, the first four perfect numbers are generated by the formula 2^(_p_−1)(2^(_p_) − 1), with _p_ a prime number, as follows:

    for _p_ = 2:   2¹(2² − 1) = 2 × 3 = 6
    for _p_ = 3:   2²(2³ − 1) = 4 × 7 = 28
    for _p_ = 5:   2⁴(2⁵ − 1) = 16 × 31 = 496
    for _p_ = 7:   2⁶(2⁷ − 1) = 64 × 127 = 8128.

Prime numbers of the form 2^(_p_) − 1 are known as Mersenne primes, after the seventeenth-century monk Marin Mersenne, who studied number theory and perfect numbers. For 2^(_p_) − 1 to be prime, it is necessary that _p_ itself be prime. However, not all numbers of the form 2^(_p_) − 1 with a prime _p_ are prime; for example, 2¹¹ − 1 = 2047 = 23 × 89 is not a prime number.[11] In fact, Mersenne primes are very rare—of the 2,610,944 prime numbers _p_ up to 43,112,609,[12] 2^(_p_) − 1 is prime for only 47 of them.

Nicomachus (60–120 AD) conjectured that every perfect number is of the form 2^(_p_−1)(2^(_p_) − 1) where 2^(_p_) − 1 is prime.[13] Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) circa 1000 AD conjectured that every _even_ perfect number is of that form.[14] It was not until the 18th century that Leonhard Euler proved that the formula 2^(_p_−1)(2^(_p_) − 1) will yield all the even perfect numbers. Thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes; each Mersenne prime generates one even perfect number, and vice versa. This result is often referred to as the Euclid–Euler theorem.

An exhaustive search by the GIMPS distributed computing project has shown that the first 47 even perfect numbers are 2^(_p_−1)(2^(_p_) − 1) for

    _p_ = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, 521, 607, 1279, 2203, 2281, 3217, 4253, 4423, 9689, 9941, 11213, 19937, 21701, 23209, 44497, 86243, 110503, 132049, 216091, 756839, 859433, 1257787, 1398269, 2976221, 3021377, 6972593, 13466917, 20996011, 24036583, 25964951, 30402457, 32582657, 37156667, 42643801 and 43112609 .[15]

Four higher perfect numbers have also been discovered, namely those for which _p_ = 57885161, 74207281, 77232917, and 82589933, though there may be others within this range. , 51 Mersenne primes are known,[16] and therefore 51 even perfect numbers (the largest of which is 2⁸²⁵⁸⁹⁹³² × (2⁸²⁵⁸⁹⁹³³ − 1) with 49,724,095 digits). It is not known whether there are infinitely many perfect numbers, nor whether there are infinitely many Mersenne primes.

As well as having the form 2^(_p_−1)(2^(_p_) − 1), each even perfect number is the triangular number (and hence equal to the sum of the integers from 1 to ) and the hexagonal number. Furthermore, each even perfect number except for 6 is the centered nonagonal number and is equal to the sum of the first odd cubes:

$$\begin{align}
6 & = 2^1(2^2-1) & & = 1+2+3, \\[8pt]
28 & = 2^2(2^3-1) & & = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 1^3+3^3, \\[8pt]
496 & = 2^4(2^5-1) & & = 1+2+3+\cdots+29+30+31 \\
& & & = 1^3+3^3+5^3+7^3, \\[8pt]
8128 & = 2^6(2^7-1) & & = 1+2+3+\cdots+125+126+127 \\
& & & = 1^3+3^3+5^3+7^3+9^3+11^3+13^3+15^3, \\[8pt]
33550336 & = 2^{12}(2^{13}-1) & & = 1+2+3+\cdots+8189+8190+8191 \\
& & & = 1^3+3^3+5^3+\cdots+123^3+125^3+127^3.
\end{align}$$

Even perfect numbers (except 6) are of the form

$$T_{2^p - 1} = 1 + \frac{(2^p-2) \times (2^p+1)}{2} = 1 + 9 \times T_{(2^p - 2)/3}$$

with each resulting triangular number T₇ = 28, T₃₁ = 496, T₁₂₇ = 8128 (after subtracting 1 from the perfect number and dividing the result by 9) ending in 3 or 5, the sequence starting with T₂ = 3, T₁₀ = 55, T₄₂ = 903, 3727815, ...[17] This can be reformulated as follows: adding the digits of any even perfect number (except 6), then adding the digits of the resulting number, and repeating this process until a single digit (called the digital root) is obtained, always produces the number 1. For example, the digital root of 8128 is 1, because 8 + 1 + 2 + 8 = 19, 1 + 9 = 10, and 1 + 0 = 1. This works with all perfect numbers 2^(_p_−1)(2^(_p_) − 1) with odd prime _p_ and, in fact, with ALL numbers of the form 2^(_m_−1)(2^(_m_) − 1) for odd integer (not necessarily prime) _m_.

Owing to their form, 2^(_p_−1)(2^(_p_) − 1), every even perfect number is represented in binary form as _p_ ones followed by _p_ − 1  zeros; for example,

    6₁₀ = 2² + 2¹ = 110₂
    28₁₀ = 2⁴ + 2³ + 2² = 11100₂
    496₁₀ = 2⁸ + 2⁷ + 2⁶ + 2⁵ + 2⁴ = 111110000₂

and

    8128₁₀ = 2¹² + 2¹¹ + 2¹⁰ + 2⁹ + 2⁸ + 2⁷ + 2⁶ = 1111111000000₂.

Thus every even perfect number is a pernicious number.

Note that every even perfect number is also a practical number (c.f. Related concepts).


Odd perfect numbers

It is unknown whether there is any odd perfect number, though various results have been obtained. In 1496, Jacques Lefèvre stated that Euclid's rule gives all perfect numbers,[18] thus implying that no odd perfect number exists. Euler stated: "Whether (...) there are any odd perfect numbers is a most difficult question".[19]
More recently, Carl Pomerance has presented a heuristic argument suggesting that indeed no odd perfect number should exist.[20] All perfect numbers are also Ore's harmonic numbers, and it has been conjectured as well that there are no odd Ore's harmonic numbers other than 1.

Any odd perfect number _N_ must satisfy the following conditions:

-   _N_ > 10¹⁵⁰⁰.[21]
-   _N_ is not divisible by 105.[22]
-   _N_ is of the form _N_ ≡ 1 (mod 12), _N_ ≡ 117 (mod 468), or _N_ ≡ 81 (mod 324).[23]
-   _N_ is of the form

_N_ = _q_^(_α_)_p_₁^(2_e_₁)⋯_p__(_k_)^(2_e__(_k_)),

    where:
    -   _q_, _p_₁, ..., _p__(_k_) are distinct primes (Euler).
    -   _q_ ≡ α ≡ 1 (mod 4) (Euler).
    -   The smallest prime factor of _N_ is less than (2_k_ + 8) / 3.[24]
    -   Either _q_^(α) > 10⁶², or _p__(_j_)^(2_e__(_j_))  > 10⁶² for some _j_.[25]
    -   _N_ < 2^(4^(_k_+1)).[26]
    -   α + 2e₁ + 2e₂ + 2e₃ + ⋯ + 2e_(k) ≥ (21k − 18)/8.[27][28]
    -   $qp_1p_2p_3 \cdots p_k < 2N^{\frac{17}{26}}$.[29]

-   The largest prime factor of _N_ is greater than 10⁸[30] and less than (3N)^(1/3) [31]
-   The second largest prime factor is greater than 10⁴, and is at most (2N)^(1/5).[32][33]
-   The third largest prime factor is greater than 100.[34]
-   _N_ has at least 101 prime factors and at least 10 distinct prime factors.[35][36] If 3 is not one of the factors of _N_, then _N_ has at least 12 distinct prime factors.[37]

In 1888, Sylvester stated:[38]

Furthermore, several minor results are known concerning to the exponents _e_₁, ..., _e__(_k_) in

_N_ = _q_^(_α_)_p_₁^(2_e_₁)⋯_p__(_k_)^(2_e__(_k_)).

-   Not all _e__(_i_) ≡ 1 (mod 3).[39]
-   Not all _e__(_i_) ≡ 2 (mod 5).[40]
-   If all _e__(_i_) ≡ 1 (mod 3) or 2 (mod 5), then the smallest prime factor of _N_ must lie between 10⁸ and 10¹⁰⁰⁰.[41]
-   More generally, if all 2_e__(_i_)+1 have a prime factor in a given finite set _S_, then the smallest prime factor of _N_ must be smaller than an effectively computable constant depending only on _S_.[42]
-   If (_e_₁, ..., _e__(_k_))=  (1, ..., 1, 2, ..., 2) with _t_ ones and _u_ twos, then $(t-1)/4 \leq u \leq 2t+\sqrt{\alpha}$.[43]
-   (_e_₁, ..., _e__(_k_)) ≠ (1, ..., 1, 3),[44] (1, ..., 1, 5), (1, ..., 1, 6).[45]
-   If _e_₁= ...= _e__(_k_)= _e_, then

:* _e_ cannot be 3,[46] 5, 24,[47] 6, 8, 11, 14 or 18.[48]

:* k ≤ 2e² + 8e + 2 and .[49]


Minor results

All even perfect numbers have a very precise form; odd perfect numbers either do not exist or are rare. There are a number of results on perfect numbers that are actually quite easy to prove but nevertheless superficially impressive; some of them also come under Richard Guy's strong law of small numbers:

-   The only even perfect number of the form _x_³ + 1 is 28 .[50]
-   28 is also the only even perfect number that is a sum of two positive cubes of integers .[51]
-   The reciprocals of the divisors of a perfect number _N_ must add up to 2 (to get this, take the definition of a perfect number, σ₁(n) = 2n, and divide both sides by _n_):
    -   For 6, we have 1/6 + 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/1 = 2;
    -   For 28, we have 1/28 + 1/14 + 1/7 + 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/1 = 2, etc.
-   The number of divisors of a perfect number (whether even or odd) must be even, because _N_ cannot be a perfect square.[52]
    -   From these two results it follows that every perfect number is an Ore's harmonic number.
-   The even perfect numbers are not trapezoidal numbers; that is, they cannot be represented as the difference of two positive non-consecutive triangular numbers. There are only three types of non-trapezoidal numbers: even perfect numbers, powers of two, and the numbers of the form 2^(n − 1)(2^(n) + 1) formed as the product of a Fermat prime 2^(n) + 1 with a power of two in a similar way to the construction of even perfect numbers from Mersenne primes.[53]
-   The number of perfect numbers less than _n_ is less than $c\sqrt{n}$, where _c_ > 0 is a constant.[54] In fact it is $o(\sqrt{n})$, using little-o notation.[55]
-   Every even perfect number ends in 6 or 28, base ten; and, with the only exception of 6, ends in 1, base 9.[56][57] Therefore in particular the digital root of every even perfect number other than 6 is 1.
-   The only square-free perfect number is 6.[58]


Related concepts

The sum of proper divisors gives various other kinds of numbers. Numbers where the sum is less than the number itself are called deficient, and where it is greater than the number, abundant. These terms, together with _perfect_ itself, come from Greek numerology. A pair of numbers which are the sum of each other's proper divisors are called amicable, and larger cycles of numbers are called sociable. A positive integer such that every smaller positive integer is a sum of distinct divisors of it is a practical number.

By definition, a perfect number is a fixed point of the restricted divisor function , and the aliquot sequence associated with a perfect number is a constant sequence. All perfect numbers are also 𝒮-perfect numbers, or Granville numbers.

A semiperfect number is a natural number that is equal to the sum of all or some of its proper divisors. A semiperfect number that is equal to the sum of all its proper divisors is a perfect number. Most abundant numbers are also semiperfect; abundant numbers which are not semiperfect are called weird numbers.

[11] All factors of 2^(_p_) − 1 are congruent to 1 mod 2_p_. For example, 2¹¹ − 1 = 2047 = 23 × 89, and both 23 and 89 yield a remainder of 1 when divided by 11. Furthermore, whenever _p_ is a Sophie Germain prime—that is, 2_p_ + 1 is also prime—and 2_p_ + 1 is congruent to 1 or 7 mod 8, then 2_p_ + 1 will be a factor of 2^(_p_) − 1, which is the case for _p_ = 11, 23, 83, 131, 179, 191, 239, 251, ... .
