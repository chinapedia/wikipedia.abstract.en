He has also addressed the UN General Assembly on the need for greater pain management in palliative care.


Career

Connor worked as CEO of four US hospice programs from 1976 to 1998.[3] From 1998 to 2008 he was Vice President of Research and Development at the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization. He is the executive director of the Worldwide Hospice Palliative Care Alliance (WHPCA), which has established organizational ties between national and regional hospice programs throughout the world.[4] Connor is also a consultant senior research fellow at Capital Care based in the Washington metropolitan area, and serves as a member of the International Work Group on Death, Dying, and Bereavement, the Association for Death Education and Counseling, and the Scientific Advisory Board of the US National Palliative Care Research Center.[5]

Connor is a member of the editorial board of the _Journal of Pain and Symptom Management_.[6] Since 2012 he has been a member of the board of trustees for the International Children's Palliative Care Network, which is represented in the steering group of the WHPCA.[7] As of 2016 he has served on the board of directors for the Elisabeth KÃ¼bler-Ross Foundation.[8]

Positions

Stephen_Connor_discussing_pain_relief_in_palliative_care,_BBC_World_News_report,_2013.webm in palliative care with the BBC World News in a special report (video), 2013]] In regards to the right to medical care (including palliative care) in Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Connor implored the UN General Assembly to provide adequate medical use of controlled substances without their misuse, calling access to pain relief "a global crisis."[12] Connor asserts that the World Health Assembly's 2014 resolution entitled "Strengthening Palliative Care as a component of Comprehensive Care Throughout the Life Course" is undermined by the pernicious lack of access to analgesics and medical opioids in some countries where stronger technical assistance and public education programs should be required.[13]

To emphasize the growing need for palliative care, Connor has highlighted the fact that globally as of 2015 there are more people over the age of 65 than under the age of 5.[14]

Connor has also stressed that global healthcare's greatest problem is the almost exclusive attention given to acute care rather than chronic care of patients.[15]
