SHAÏDA ZARUMEY (born FATOUMA AGNÈS DIAROUMÈYE, 1938) is a Nigerien sociologist and poet, one of the first in her country to write in French.

Born in Bamako to a Nigerien father and a Malian mother, Diaroumèye spent the first ten years of her life in Niger, where she completed her primary studies. She continued her education in Mali[1] before obtaining a doctorate in Paris in 1970. A socioeconomist by training, she began working in Dakar at the _Institut Africain de Développement Économique et de Planification_ of the United Nations, where she was employed from 1970 to 1975; she then became a functionary dedicated to women's rights.[2] She has traveled widely in support of her work.[3] As a poet, under the _nom de plume_ Shaïda Zarumey, she published _Alternances pour le sultan_ in 1981.[4]
