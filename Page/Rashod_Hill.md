Professional career

Jacksonville Jaguars

Hill signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars as an undrafted free agent on May 1, 2016.[2] In the preseason opener at the New York Jets on August 11, 2016, Hill played 15 snaps at right tackle. The following game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he was on the field for 16 snaps. The win over the Bengals in Week 3 was Hillâ€™s longest outing by far, as he played 44 snaps. After the Jaguars placed veteran Jeff Linkenbach on injured reserve on August 22, Hill was named the primary backup to starter Jermey Parnell. In the final preseason game, Hill started at right tackle on Thursday night against the Atlanta Falcons at the Georgia Dome.[3] Hill was activated for the game against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 3, but did not play.

Minnesota Vikings

On November 15, 2016, Hill was signed off the Jaguars' practice squad by the Minnesota Vikings.[4] Hill made his first NFL appearance in Week 17 after starting left tackle T. J. Clemmings went out with an injury early in the game against the Chicago Bears; for the game, he was the highest-graded offensive lineman for Minnesota according to Pro Football Focus (PFF) with a 78.5 score on their rating system, as he didn't allow a sack, hit or hurry of Sam Bradford in his 36 pass-blocking snaps.[5] It was Hill's first game action since his college days.[6]

Hill entered the 2017 season as the Vikings backup tackle. He earned his first start of the season at right tackle in place of the injured Mike Remmers.

Hill entered the 2018 season as the Vikings starting right tackle. He was moved over to left tackle from Weeks 6-8 in place of an injured Riley Reiff. During that time, rookie Brian O'Neill started at right tackle in his place. After Reiff returned from injury, Hill was demoted to a backup role the rest of the season as O'Neill had played well in his place.

On March 11, 2019, the Vikings placed a low-level restricted free agent tender on Hill.[7]

On April 15, 2019, the Vikings re-signed Hill.[8]
