DEREK HULAK (born September 2, 1989) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward who is currently an unrestricted free agent. He most recently played for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL).


Playing career

Undrafted out of the University of Saskatchewan,[1] Hulak joined the Texas Stars of the American Hockey League (AHL). He won a Calder Cup with the Stars in 2014.[2]

In 2016, Hulak signed a one-year contract with the Utica Comets after two full seasons with the Stars.[3]

After enduring the 2016–17 season interrupted through injury with the Comets, Hulak left as a free agent to sign with his third AHL club, the Lehigh Valley Phantoms on a one-year deal on July 6, 2017.[4] Hulak was unable to make an appearance with the Phantoms through the entire 2017–18 season, due to continuing injury woes.

On October 5, 2018, the Hershey Bears signed Hulak to a professional tryout (PTO), making the opening night roster for the 2018–19 season.[5] Hulak appeared in eight games through to December, recording two goals and one assist, before he was released from his tryout on December 4.[6] On December 5, the Grand Rapids Griffins signed Hulak to a PTO.[7] He posted 1 goal in 9 games with the Griffins before securing a one-year contract for the remainder of the season with the club on December 28, 2018.[8]


Personal life

His brother is Dan Hulak, a former ice hockey player. He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft.[9]
