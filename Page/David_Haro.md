In July 2010, Haro joined Tercera División side AE Prat.[2] On 2 June of the following year, after being a key unit for the club, he signed for CE L'Hospitalet in Segunda División B.[3]

On 26 June 2012, Haro signed a one-year contract with Gimnàstic de Tarragona, freshly relegated to the third level.[4] After being mainly used as a substitute, he returned to _Hospi_ on 10 July 2013.[5]

On 4 July 2015, Haro agreed to a two-year deal with CF Reus Deportiu, still in the third division.[6] He scored ten goals for the club during the campaign (including two in the play-off finals against Racing de Santander), as his side achieved promotion to Segunda División for the first time ever.

Haro made his professional debut on 6 November 2016, replacing Jorge Miramón in a 0–1 home loss against Levante UD.[7]

CF Reus Deportiu reached a consensus to prolong his stay in spite of making 7 appearances without a goal.[8]
