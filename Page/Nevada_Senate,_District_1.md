Elections

2012

In the 2012 election, the opponents were Democrat Pat Spearman and Gregory Hughes, a member of the Independent American Party. No Republican candidate filed for the senate seat.[11] For the Democrats, a primary was held, because both Spearman and Democrat John Jay Lee filed for the office. Lee was a two-term incumbent of the first senatorial district before its borders were redrawn.[12] Spearman, who is LGBT, is a veteran and a former evangelist minister, and she had never held political office.[13][14] She argued the district needed a "real democrat."[15] Lee, a Mormon, who opposed gay marriage, said he wasn't worried by Spearman, as he thought Spearman had been "encouraged to run by supporters of single issues like gay rights."[16][17] Spearman won the primary, that was held on June 12, with over 60% of the votes.[18]

One of the most important topics of Spearman's campaign was education, for which she wanted to raise funding. Hughes, a veteran as well, said he wanted to focus on creating jobs and growing the economy.[19] On November 6, Spearman won the elections with nearly 70% of the votes.[20]
