FUTURE D. FIDEL is a Congolese-Australian playwright.

Future Destiny Fidel was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and became an orphan at the age of 13. Living with his sister at Uvira on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, he fled across the lake to Tanzania when his village was threatened by soldiers during civil unrest.[1] He spent eight years in Nyarugusu, a Tanzanian refugee camp, before coming to Australia as a refugee in 2005.[2]

In Australia, Fidel joined a Kwatamaja (African) Dance Group, participated in acting workshops and with other young refugees formed the Fimbo Boys performing African modern dance and song. He contributed to the community theatre work _I Am Here_ featuring young people who came to Australia following conflict.[3]

Fidel graduated in 2013 as an electrical engineer.[4]

_Prize Fighter_, his first full-length play, was premiered by La Boite Theatre and Brisbane Festival in 2015. Fidel was nominated for Best New Australian Work and the production was nominated for Best Play at the 2016 Helpmann Awards.[5]
