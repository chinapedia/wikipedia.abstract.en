Two rounds of a GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION were held in Jakarta as part of the 2017 simultaneous elections on 15 February and 19 April 2017 to elect the Governor of Jakarta to a five-year term. Incumbent governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, popularly referred to as "Ahok", and his deputy Djarot Saiful Hidayat were running for re-election to a second term. Basuki, who inherited his current position from his running mate Joko Widodo when he won the 2014 Indonesian presidential election, would have become the first elected Chinese-Christian governor of Jakarta had he won.

Under the constitution, if no candidate secured a majority of the votes, a runoff election would be held between the top two candidates. The results of quick counts in the first round indicated that Purnama led by a narrow 3–4% margin, and that a runoff would be held on 19 April.

Quick counts for the 19 April runoff indicated that Anies Baswedan was elected as governor; Ahok concedes defeat hours after the polls closed. The official results of the election is Anies Baswedan - Sandiaga Uno 57.96% to Basuki Tjahaja Purnama - Djarot Saiful Hidayat 42.04% published by the KPU in May;[1][2] however, unofficial tallies from the election commission showed that Baswedan won 58% to Ahok's 42%.[3][4]


Candidates

Under regulations, only political parties having 22 seats or more in the regional parliament (DPRD) can put forward a candidate. Political parties with fewer seats can put forward a candidate only if they have acquired support from other political parties. Independent candidates are able to run if they have gathered at least 532,213 signatures from local residents, which will be verified by the local election committee.

This election will be contested by three candidates together with their running mate.[5]

Campaign and issues

Racism

A candidate and a member of a minority ethnic group, Basuki has become the subject of occasional racist comments. During the 2017 gubernatorial campaign, he was regularly targeted by ultra-conservatives and supporters of rival candidates for being of Chinese descent. Furthermore, Basuki's "double minority" background makes him a target of the hardliner Islamic Defenders Front (FPI). The group called for the revision of the Jakarta constitution to remove some of the governor's responsibilities for government-affiliated Islamic organizations.

Allegations of Quran insult

On 27 September 2016, in a speech in front of citizens of Thousand Islands, Ahok noted that some citizens would not vote for him because they are being "deceived using Verse 51 of Al Maidah and variations of it,"[6] referring to a verse that some groups have cited as grounds to oppose him.[7] The provincial government of Jakarta uploaded the video recording to YouTube in a channel which often feature Ahok's activities.[8] Citizens and pundits criticized Ahok's statement, considering it an insult on the Quran.[9] The video became viral and Ahok was widely criticized in social media such as Facebook and Twitter. A _Change.org_ petition criticising him gained tens of thousands of signatures.[10]
