CASTLE CRAIG ROCK is a prominent geological feature to the south of Kawhia Harbour in the Waikato Region of New Zealand. It is located 9 km from Marokopa, Waikato, New Zealand, above the valley of the Marokopa River. Castle Craig Rock is a type of flaggy Limestone (sandstone).[1] It stands 610 feet (186m) above sea level and provides an expansive view of Castle Craig Farm, an organic beef farm, plus the little town of Awamarino.[2]

The rock formation is mentioned in the magazine "New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics 1967 Vol.10 No.4" by PJ Barrett, where he mentions the pebble band in the flaggy limestone.[3] In March, 2019 the surrounding farm hosted a 250km 4WD off-road race organized by the Waikato Off Road Racing Club.[4]
