TROGTALITE is a rare selenide mineral with the formula CoSe_(2.) It crystallizes in the cubic system and is part of the pyrite group, consisting of Co²⁺ and Se₂^(2−) ions. It has a rose-violet colour and its crystals are opaque.[1] It often occurs as grains. It was thought to be dimorphous with hastite, but this was discredited in 2009.[2] Hastite turned out to be the iron selenide mineral ferroselite.[3] It forms a solid solution series with krut'aite.


Occurrence

Trogtalite was first found in 1955 in Trogtal quarry, Lautenthal, Harz Mountains, Germany, after which it was also named. It often occurs intergrown with clausthalite grains at this locality. It has also been found in the Musonoi Cu–Co mine, Kolwezi, Katanga Province, Congo and in Argentina, in Tuminico, Sierra de Cacho, and in Los Llantenes, La Rioja Province. It is often found together with clausthalite, ferroselite, bornhardtite, selenium, gold, and oosterboschite.[4]
