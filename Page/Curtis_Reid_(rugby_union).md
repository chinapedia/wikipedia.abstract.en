CURTIS REID (born 11 December 1994) is a New Zealand rugby union player. He currently plays for Manawatu in the Mitre 10 Cup.[1][2]

Originally from Auckland, Reid attended Westlake Boys High School.

In 2015 Reid was part of the set-up, however he only played matches for North Harbour B as others were preferred over him.[3]

In early 2016 Reid moved down to Palmerston North to complete a business degree.[4] He joined the College Old Boys club and based on a strong first club season he was selected for two Manawatu pre-season games.

He was then offered a full contract and he made his debut on 26 August against Southland.
