History

Empire of Japan

TRFI was originally established as a nursery on 6 January 1896 during the Japanese rule of Taiwan.[1] In October 1900, a new plot of land was purchased at the present location of Taipei Botanical Garden and the nursery was named the TAIPEI NURSERY. In 1911, on the foundation of Taipei Nursery, the FORESTRY EXPERIMENTAL STATION was established to handle the management of forest in Taiwan. In 1921, the Japanese government unified all research institutes in Taiwan and established the Central Research Institute which included the Forestry Experimental Station but was named the FORESTRY DIVISION of the Central Research Institute. In 1939, the Central Research Institute was reorganized and the Forestry Division was made independent named FORESTRY RESEARCH INSTITUTE.

Republic of China

After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China, it was later renamed to TAIWAN FORESTRY RESEARCH INSTITUTE on 1 November 1945 and placed under the Taiwan Provincial Government. In September 1949, the research institute was transferred under the Agriculture and Forestry Administration. In July 1999, the research institute was formally renamed TAIWAN FORESTRY RESEARCH INSTITUTE, COUNCIL OF AGRICULTURE (COA), EXECUTIVE YUAN.[2]
