KEITH INCH CASTLE, or Tower, was a 16th century L-plan tower house and courtyard, about east of Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, on Keith Inch, to the north of Peterhead Bay.[1]

An alternative name was Keith Insch Castle.[2]


History

The tower, probably built soon after 1589,[3] belonged to the Keith Earls Marischal. It was extended with artillery fortifications. It was bought by the Arbuthnotts after 1715. They built a new house, and the tower fell into disuse.[4]


Structure

The castle had four storeys, and a garret; the wing was a later addition.[5] The tower itself was round, and the addition, an unadorned house, was on the landward side.[6]

About 1813 the castle was demolished to make way for harbour and other improvements.[7]
