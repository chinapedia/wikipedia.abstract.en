THOMAS PENN (11 October 1897 – 1978), known as TOM or TOMMY PENN, was an English footballer who played as a full back in the Football League for Bristol City, Darlington and Swindon Town. He also played non-league football for Methley Perseverance, Altofts West Riding Colliery, Gainsborough Trinity, Yeovil & Petters United and Bath City.


Life and career

Penn was born in Heath Common, West Riding of Yorkshire,[1] in 1897.[2] He played football for nearby Methley Perseverance[3] and Altofts West Riding Colliery before signing for Football League Second Division club Bristol City in 1925. He appeared in six Football League games in his first season,[4] but in his second, his appearances were restricted to the reserve team in the Western and Southern Leagues.[5] In July 1927 he joined Darlington, newly relegated to the Third Division North.[6] He went straight into the team, had a run of 7 matches at left back before losing his place, first to Tommy Greaves and then to James Mellon, and finished the season with 16 appearances, 14 in the league and 2 in the FA Cup.[7]

Penn joined Midland League club Gainsborough Trinity ahead of the 1928–29 season, and returned to the Football League with Swindon Town at the end of it.[8] He came into the side to replace the ageing Wally Dickinson, and played regularly until April 1930, but appeared only once for the first team in 1930–31.[9] Penn joined Southern League Yeovil & Petters United on trial in November 1931 and, although initially reluctant to accept the terms offered, signed a contract in January 1932.[10] He remained with the club until the end of the season before returning to Gainsborough for 1932–33.[11] Penn made one first-team appearance for Bath City during the 1933–34 season.[12]

He died in 1978 aged about 80.[13]
