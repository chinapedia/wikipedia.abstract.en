TRUXINIC ACIDS are any of several stereoisomeric cyclic dicarboxylic acids with the formula (C₆H₅)₂C₄H₄(COOH)₂, found in various plants.[1][2] They are obtained by a photochemical cycloaddition from cinnamic acid,[3] where the two _trans_ alkenes react head-to-head.


Isomers

These compounds have four chiral carbon atoms, which looks like there should be 16 (2⁴) stereoisomers. However, the symmetry of the molecule allows for only ten possibilities, of which six have been described in literature:[4][5]
