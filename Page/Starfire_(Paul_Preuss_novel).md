_STARFIRE_ is a science fiction novel by author Paul Preuss. First published in February 1988,[1] it is about a group of NASA astronauts on a mission to an asteroid which is falling into the Sun.

According to the novel's afterword, Preuss and Gary Gutierrez, special visual effects supervisor on the films _The Right Stuff_ and _Top Gun_, first conceived the story as a realistic science fiction film. When they realized that the film would be too expensive to make, Preuss turned the story into a novel.[2] Preuss and Gutierrez share the book's copyright.


Reception

_Kirkus Reviews_ commented, "Intriguing and satisfying problem-solving for about half... but even the most benign readers will be tempted to skip the old-hat plotting and elephantine stereotype-building that goes before."[3] _Publishers Weekly_ said that "Preuss makes good use of his familiarity with both the innovators and bureaucrats of science... the characters never come alive and the workaday details of spaceflight seem humdrum."[4]
