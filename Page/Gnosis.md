GNOSIS is the common Greek noun for knowledge (γνῶσις, _gnōsis_, f.).[1] The term is used in various Hellenistic religions and philosophies.[2][3] It is best known from Gnosticism, where it signifies a knowledge or insight into humanity’s real nature as divine, leading to the deliverance of the divine spark within humanity from the constraints of earthly existence.[4][5]


Etymology

_Gnosis_ is a feminine Greek noun which means "knowledge".[6] It is often used for personal knowledge compared with intellectual knowledge (εἶδειν _eídein_), as with the French _connaître_ compared with _savoir_, the Spanish _conocer_ compared with _saber_, the Italian _conoscere_ compared with _sapere_, or the German _kennen_ rather than _wissen_.[7]

A related term is the adjective _gnostikos_, "cognitive",[8] a reasonably common adjective in Classical Greek.[9] Plato uses the plural adjective γνωστικοί – _gnostikoi_ and the singular feminine adjective γνωστικὴ ἐπιστήμη – _gnostike episteme_ in his _Politikos_ where _Gnostike episteme_ was also used to indicate one's aptitude. The terms do not appear to indicate any mystic, esoteric or hidden meaning in the works of Plato, but instead expressed a sort of higher intelligence and ability analogous to talent.[10]

In the Hellenistic era the term became associated with the mystery cults.

_Gnosis_ is used throughout Greek philosophy as a technical term for experience knowledge (see gnosiology) in contrast to theoretical knowledge or epistemology. The term is also related to the study of knowledge retention or memory (see also cognition), in relation to ontic or ontological, which is how something actually is rather than how something is captured (abstraction) and stored (memory) in the mind.

Irenaeus used the phrase "knowledge falsely so-called" (_pseudonymos gnosis_, from 1 Timothy 6:20)[11] for the title of his book _On the Detection and Overthrow of False Knowledge_, that contains the adjective _gnostikos_, which is the source for the 17th-century English term "Gnosticism".


Judeo-Christian usage

Hellenistic Jewish literature

The Greek word _gnosis_ (knowledge) is used as a standard translation of the Hebrew word "knowledge" (דעת da'ath) in the Septuagint, thus: Philo also refers to the "knowledge" (_gnosis_) and "wisdom" (_sophia_) of God.[12]

New Testament

Paul distinguishes "knowledge" (_gnosis_) and "knowledge falsely so-called" (_pseudonymos gnosis_).

In the writings of the Greek Fathers

The fathers of early Christianity used the word "knowledge" (_gnosis_) in the New Testament to mean spiritual knowledge or specific knowledge of the divine. This positive usage was to contrast it with how gnostic sectarians used the word. This positive use carried over from Hellenic philosophy into Greek Orthodoxy as a critical characteristic of ascetic practices, through St. Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus, Hippolytus of Rome, Hegesippus, and Origen.

Cardiognosis ("knowledge of the heart") from Eastern Christianity related to the tradition of the staretz and in Roman Catholic theology is the view that only God knows the condition of one's relationship with God.[13][14]

In Eastern Orthodox thought

Gnosis in Orthodox Christian (primarily Eastern Orthodox) thought is the spiritual knowledge of a saint (one who has obtained theosis)[15] or mystically enlightened human being. Within the cultures of the term's provenance (Byzantine and Hellenic) _Gnosis_ was a knowledge or insight into the infinite, divine and uncreated in all and above all,[16] rather than knowledge strictly into the finite, natural or material world.[17] Gnosis is transcendental as well as mature understanding. It indicates direct spiritual, experiential knowledge[18] and intuitive knowledge, mystic rather than that from rational or reasoned thinking. Gnosis itself is gained through understanding at which one can arrive via inner experience or contemplation such as an internal epiphany of intuition and external epiphany such as the Theophany.

In the _Philokalia,_ it is emphasized that such knowledge is not secret knowledge but rather a maturing, transcendent form of knowledge derived from contemplation (_theoria_ resulting from practice of _hesychasm)_, since knowledge cannot truly be derived from knowledge, but rather, knowledge can only be derived from _theoria_ (to witness, see (vision) or experience).[19] Knowledge, thus plays an important role in relation to _theosis_ (deification/personal relationship with God) and _theoria_ (revelation of the divine, vision of God).[20] Gnosis, as the proper use of the spiritual or noetic faculty plays an important role in Orthodox Christian theology. Its importance in the economy of salvation is discussed periodically in the _Philokalia_ where as direct, personal knowledge of God (noesis; see also Noema) it is distinguished from ordinary epistemological knowledge (episteme—i.e., speculative philosophy).


Gnosticism

Gnosticism originated in the late first century CE in nonrabbinical Jewish sects and early Christian sects. In the formation of Christianity, various sectarian groups, labeled "gnostics" by their opponents, emphasised spiritual knowledge (_gnosis_) of the Divine spark within, over faith (_pistis_) in the teachings and traditions of the various communities of Christians.[21] Gnosticism presents a distinction between the highest, unknowable God, and the demiurge “creator” of the material universe. The Gnostics considered the most essential part of the process of salvation to be this personal knowledge, in contrast to faith as an outlook in their world view along with faith in the ecclesiastical authority. They were regarded as heretics by the Fathers of the early church.

[15] "Spiritual knowledge is the state of spiritual theoria, when one sees invisibly and hears inaudibly and comprehends incomprehensibly the glory of God. Precisely then comprehension ceases and, what is more, he understands that he does not understand. Within the vision of the uncreated Light man also sees angels and Saints and, in general, he experiences communion with the angels and the Saints. He is then certain that resurrection exists. This is the spiritual knowledge which all the holy Prophets, the Apostles, Martyrs, ascetics and all the Saints of the Church had. The teachings of the Saints are an offspring of this spiritual knowledge. And, naturally, as we said earlier, spiritual knowledge is a fruit of the vision of God.

[17] Faith And Science In Orthodox Gnosiology And Methodology by George Metallinos "The scientist and professor of the knowledge of the Uncreated, in the Orthodox Tradition, is the Geron/Starets (the Elder or Spiritual Father), the guide or "teacher of the desert." The recording of both types of knowledge presupposes empirical knowledge of the phenomenon. The same holds true in the field of science, where only the specialist understands the research of other scientists of the same field. The adoption of conclusions or findings of a scientific branch by non-specialists (i.e. those who are unable to experimentally examine the research of the specialists) is based on the trust of the specialists credibility. Otherwise, there would be no scientific progress. The same holds true for the science of faith. The empirical knowledge of the Saints, Prophets, Apostles, Fathers and Mothers of all ages is adopted and founded upon the same trust. The patristic tradition and the Church's Councils function on this provable experience. There is no Ecumenical Council without the presence of the glorified/deified (theoumenoi), those who see the divine (this is the problem of the councils of today!) Orthodox doctrine results from this relationship." University of Athens - Department of Theology
