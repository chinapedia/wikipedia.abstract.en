"THE RICKS MUST BE CRAZY" is the sixth episode in the second season of the American animated television sitcom _Rick and Morty_, and the seventeenth overall episode in the series. Written by Dan Guterman and directed by Dominic Polcino, the episode first aired on Adult Swim in the United States on August 30, 2015. The title of the episode is a reference to the 1980 film _The Gods Must Be Crazy_.[1]

In the episode, Rick and Morty go inside Rick's microverse car battery, an entire planet that generates electricity to power Rick's car, unbeknown to the citizens of the microverse. Zeep Xanflorp, a scientist in the microverse, creates his own microverse, thus stopping the flow of energy to Rick's car. The episode largely takes place in Zeep's microverse, with Rick, Morty and Zeep attempting to escape it.


Plot

After viewing "Ball Fondlers: The Movie" in an alternate dimension, Rick, Morty and Summer discover that Ricks car won't start because its battery is malfunctioning. Rick takes Morty inside the car battery to repair it and leaves Summer waiting in the car after giving it the instruction "Keep Summer safe." Morty discovers that the car battery is actually a 'microverse battery', containing an entire universe to supply power to the car. Rick gave "gooble box" technology to an intelligent species to generate electricity but unbeknownst to them, Rick takes a majority of the generated power. This leads Morty to question Rick's ethics.

Rick and Morty discover that a scientist and microverse citizen named Zeep Xanflorp (Stephen Colbert) has made his own 'miniverse', which renders gooble boxes obsolete. Rick, Morty and Zeep enter the miniverse, and discover that Kyle, a scientist living in Zeep's battery, is also working on his own 'teenyverse', which Morty and the three scientists enter. Once both Zeep and Kyle discover that they are slaves born to make electricity, Zeep attacks Rick in a rage. During the struggle, Kyle commits suicide using his spaceship, leaving Rick, Morty and Zeep stranded in the teenyverse.

Following Morty's demand (and several months trapped in the primordial teenyverse), Rick and Zeep put aside their differences and create a way to get back to Zeep's world. However, when they get back, Zeep attempts to kill Rick and Morty by destroying his miniverse while they are still inside, but fails, after a brawl with Rick that ultimately defeats him. After Rick and Morty safely make their way back to their universe, Zeep realises he must stop his experimentation with miniverse technology or Rick would "toss a broken battery" and in doing so destroy his entire universe.

Back in the parking lot, Rick's car uses extreme defensive tactics, including dicing up a person, paralysation and psychological torture, to keep Summer safe from various assailants. While a horrified Summer attempts to stop the car from hurting anyone, an escalating standoff ensues between the parked car and the police and military. Upon Summer's continued demand, Rick's car forgoes physical and psychological violence and instead escapes the situation by engineering a peace treaty between the planet's two warring factions, humans and giant spiders, in return for guaranteed safety.


Reception

"The Ricks Must Be Crazy" has received generally positive reviews. Joe Matar of _Den of Geek_ gave the episode a 5/5 rating, saying that "This is a fantastic episode that takes Rick and Morty’s established tropes and plays with them in really fun ways."[2] Stacey Taylor of _Geek Syndicate_ gave the episode a 4/5 rating, saying that "The Ricks Must Be Crazy is an almost perfect episode, with the laughs coming thick and fast but serving not to downplay the death, or the dark and disturbing sequences, but more to compliment them."[3] Jesse Schedeen of _IGN_ gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10 rating, saying that "This week's episode didn't quite reach the heights this show is capable of, but it was an all-around entertaining installment."[4] Zack Handlen of _The A.V. Club_ gave the episode an A- rating, noting that "What makes Rick such a fascinating anti-hero is that the more we see of the realities of this show, the less he seems like an “anti-hero” at all."[5]
