_HEAD OF SAINT JOHN THE BAPTIST_ is a marble sculpture by French artist Auguste Rodin, sculpted in 1887 as part of a series of sculptures based on his _Saint John the Baptist_, exhibited for the first time in 1880 with great acceptance and recognition from critics.[1]

In this sculpture, Rodin decides not to present the fragment as a bust, the most obvious choice, but to set the head on its side on a baptismal font in order to establish a greater reference to the biblical account of John the Baptist and to separate it from the rest of the fragment that would later be nicknamed _The Walking Man_, which had been stripped of all religious tendencies.

After Rodin decides to separate the sculpture based on the strong criticism it received,[2] he realizes that he can imbue gestures in several discrete instants beginning with the separation of the head from the rest of the body; some authors have cited this as one of several examples of Rodin's achievement of stopping time as a counter-statement to the usage of photography in gestures.[3]
