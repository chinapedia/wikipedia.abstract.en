The RIO VERDE is a river in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. It is a tributary of the Paran치 River.

The Cisalpina Private Natural Heritage Reserve protects the region where the Rio Verde and Paran치 River converge, and contains a complex system of interconnected lagoons, streams and channels connected to the channel of the Paran치, which has shifted its bed to the east over time. There are traces of old channels of the Paran치 dating back 10,000 to 40,000 years.
