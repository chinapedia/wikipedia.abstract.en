The 2016–17 UMASS LOWELL RIVER HAWKS WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM represented the University of Massachusetts Lowell during the 2016–17 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. The River Hawks were led by second year head coach Jenerrie Harris and once again played most their home games in the Costello Athletic Center while select games were played in the Tsongas Center at UMass Lowell as members of the America East Conference.

UMass Lowell was in the fourth and final year of a transition to Division I and thus ineligible for the postseason, including the America East Tournament.

They finished the season 3–26, 0–16 in America East play to finish in last place.
