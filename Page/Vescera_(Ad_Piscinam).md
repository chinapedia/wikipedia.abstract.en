VESCERA, also known as Ad Piscinam, was an ancient titular see and Roman colony in Roman North Africa. It has been identified as a site near Biskra in Algeria. It remains as a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church in the Province of Numidia.[1]


History

The city was founded soon after the arrival of the Romans around 200 AD under Septimius Severus' and became part of the province of Numidia. As a major settlement in the border region, it was significant even then. Its name was apparently bowdlerized by the Romans to _Ad Piscīnam_ ("at the _piscīna_"), implying the presence of important waterworks.

The city fell to the Arab armies during the end of the 7th century. A significant portion of the inhabitants of the area still descend from the Arab bedouin tribe of Banu Hilal,[2] others are mainly Chaoui Berbers.


Bishopric

The city was the seat of a bishopric in Roman times and was one of the main centers in the Donatist schism of the 4th century. Three bishops are known:

-   Optatus (Catholic) fl.411 and friend of Augustine of Hippo[3]
-   Fortunatus(Donatist) fl.411
-   Felix (Catholic) fl.484.

In the 20th century the bishopric was nominally re-established as a titular see and three bishops are known.
