_ME AND MY CAT?_ is a 1999 children's picture book by Satoshi Kitamura. It is about a boy, Nicholas, who switches bodies with his cat, Leonardo.


Reception

In a review, the New York Times wrote "Kitamura's art resembles the animation seen on the Cartoon Network, edgy and angular, a style that becomes a barrier to the artist's intent when the plan is to depict the smooth, springy suppleness of cats. And that -- evoking memories of familiar feline postures for the sake of a laugh -- is what this book is all about. Still, many children will no doubt respond with laugh-track chuckles, especially to the sight of a boy squatting in a litter box. My test audience -- that is, my inner 6-year-old -- obviously did not."[1] while _Kirkus Reviews_ calls it "Silly good fun."[2] and _Publishers Weekly_ wrote "this latest by Kitamura spotlights an offbeat sense of humor and a flair for comic-book layout."[3]

It has also been reviewed by _Booklist_,[4] the _School Library Journal_,[5] and _The Horn Book Magazine_.[6]
