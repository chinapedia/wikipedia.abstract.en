The CHURCH OF THE HOLY FAMILY[1] (, , ) also known as the CHAPEL OF THE HOLY FAMILY, is a Catholic church building located in the Austrian Hospice[2] in the Old City of Jerusalem.

The church building originated as a pilgrim hostel of the Catholic Church created in 1853 by the Austrians in Jerusalem (_Österreichisches Hospiz zur Heiligen Familie_). The chapel of the complex was ceremonially consecrated 19 March 1863 by the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Giuseppe Valerga, open to pilgrims of the Latin rite.[3]

The liturgical organ of the chapel was built in 1910 by the Rieger organ manufacturer of Jägerndorf (now Krnov) in the Czech Republic (in 1910 in Austria-Hungary).[4]
