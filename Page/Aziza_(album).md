_AZIZA_ is a studio album by English jazz bassist Dave Holland together with saxophonist Chris Potter, guitarist Lionel Loueke, and drummer Eric Harland.[1] The album was released on October 14, 2016 via Holland's own Dare2 Records label.[2]


Background

Dave Holland explained that the name _Aziza_ has come from one of their songs, “Aziza Dance,” written by Lionel Loueke. In Loueke's birthplace of Benin, _Aziza_ means a supernatural race of forest dwellers giving practical and spiritual advice.[3] The album features eight original compositions—two from each band member.[4]


Reception

Cormak Larkin of _The Irish Times_ noted, "...there’s no doubting who is the elder statesman here, nor whose spirit is guiding proceedings. Dave Holland has been taking music in new and interesting directions since the late 1960s. And though each member of Aziza contributes a couple of tunes and brings their own unique character to the mix, most audible in this new group’s taut, funky, expansive sound are echoes of former Holland projects such as his Extensions quartet, and even the distant rumble of the great Gateway Trio".[5]

John McBeath of _The Australian_ wrote, "This quartet is four stellar US musicians, all bandleaders, and each at the very top of their abilities, working beautifully together....These four names will probably be sufficient to invite a listening for jazz fans where the spectrum of emotion and diversity of approach is bound to secure interest."[6]
