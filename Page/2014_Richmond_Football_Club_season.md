Reserves

In 2014 Richmond broke away from their affiliated status with Coburg to field a stand-alone reserves side for the first time in over a decade. The team competed in the VFL and played home games at the club's Punt Road home. Richmond senior and rookie-listed players who were not selected to play in the AFL side were eligible to play for the team alongside a small squad of VFL-only listed players. The team finished 12th out of 16 participating clubs, with a record of 6 wins, one draw and 11 losses.[21]
