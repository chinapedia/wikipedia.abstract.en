_THUGS 'N' KISSES_ is a various artists compilation album released on September 12, 1995 by Re-Constriction Records.[1]


Reception

The _Alternative Press_ described it as "sixteen aggressive guitar/synth combinations aimed at frequenters of mosh pits who have little or no regard for their own personal safety."[2] _Aiding & Abetting_ also reviewed the compilation positively, saying the album "has tracks from some of the best in the business" and "the result is an almost seamless foray into a nice industrial-techno subgenre."[3] _Sonic Boom_ called the release "a very solid collection of electrocore bands proving once again that there is more to industrial guitar music than the MTV poster child NIN would lead us to believe."[4]
