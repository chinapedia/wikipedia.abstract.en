WEBSLEUTHS is an internet community that is focused on crime and missing persons. The privately owned Websleuths LLC maintains a forum for registered users to discuss and classify information related to crimes, trials and unsolved cases, which they try to solve. Tricia Griffith (not to be confused with Progressive's CEO of the same name) purchased the site in 2004.[1]

Some content is available for viewing without registration. Members have an option to be verified with their credentials with the administrator if they have a specific expertise, such as DNA analysis professionals, law enforcement, or are related to a specific crime in some way.[2]


Notable cases

Crimes which have received national attention are always highlighted by Websleuths. The 2008 Caylee Anthony murder and 2011 trial of her mother drew years of interest and commentary regarding the murder, media attention to the case, and documentation of evidence and information.[3] The television show _Law & Order_ portrayed Websleuths in an episode about the Anthony case named "Crimebusters".

In 2014 Carl Koppelman, a California man who is a member of Websleuths, believed that he had identified a match between a new image of Tammy Alexander, long missing from Hernando County, Florida, and a forensic portrait of a young unidentified homicide victim known as Caledonia Jane Doe, found in Livingston County, New York in 1979. He notified both Sheriff's offices and the NamUs database administrators. With this lead, police were able to make a DNA match between the victim and her half-sister, confirming her in January 2015 as Alexander more than 35 years after her death.[4]


Alliances and other activities

Tricia Griffith hosts a weekly podcast on Blog Talk Radio.[5] In 2016, Websleuths joined the producers of the television show _The Killing Season_ in an interactive look at the unsolved Long Island serial killer cases.[6]
