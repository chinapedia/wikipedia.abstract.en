ROGER HODGMAN (born 1 December 1943[1]) is an award-winning Australian stage and television director.

He was educated at the Hutchins School and the University of Tasmania, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English and Political Science in 1966, and an Honours degree in History in 1972. After beginning his career as a television director with the ABC in 1965, Hodgman worked in London between 1971 and 1977 where he taught acting at East 15 Acting School. He worked in Canada from 1977 to 1983, including as Artistic Director of the Vancouver Playhouse for three years from 1978 to 1981[2] where he collaborated with Tennessee Williams on productions of Williams' later plays _The Red Devil Battery Sign_ and _The Notebook of Trigorin_.

In 1983 Hodgman became Dean of the School of Drama at the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne, establishing more orthodox acting training than under his predecessor Peter Oyston.[3] He became Associate Director of the Melbourne Theatre Company in 1984, was appointed joint Artistic Director in 1986, and held the position of Artistic Director from 1988 to 1999.[4][5] He has since directed plays, operas, musicals and television in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Japan.

His awards include a Helpmann Award for Best Direction of a Musical for _Grey Gardens_ (for The Production Company) and Green Room Awards for Best Director for _Whoâ€™s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?_ and _A Little Night Music_ (for Melbourne Theatre Company).
