Contents

_M Train_ is Smith's second memoir,[2] following the 2010 National Book Award-winning _Just Kids_.[3] While _Just Kids_ recounts Smith's early life, the beginning of her career and particularly her relationship with artist Robert Mapplethorpe,[4] _M Train_ focuses on a later portion of her life, the period since the release of her debut album _Horses_ in 1975.[5] The memoir particularly recounts the personal losses that marked the forty-year span between _Horses_ and _M Train_, including the deaths of Mapplethorpe in 1989, of AIDS; Smith's husband, guitarist Fred "Sonic" Smith, in 1994 at 45, of heart failure;[6] and Smith's brother Todd a month later, of a stroke.[7]

The book also discusses the 16 years in this period during which Smith was not performing; instead, living in Detroit with her husband and two children, she spent early mornings writing stories before her family awoke.[8] The title, _M Train_, referring to this imaginative work, invokes a "mind train" that "goes to any station it wants."[9]


Reception

_M Train_ received strongly favorable reviews_._ In _The New York Times_, book critic Michiko Kakutani called the book "achingly beautiful" with "lyrical and radiantly pictorial" prose.[10] In _The Washington Post_, novelist Elizabeth Hand described the book as being as "perceptive and beautifully written as its predecessor" _Just Kids_.[11] In one mild dissent, novelist Charles Finch wrote in the _Chicago Tribune_ that _M Train_ "didn't change my life" but "it's also easy to see why so many readers say that it has," noting it shares _Just Kids_' "gangly but lovely writing, the same resolute faith in the consolations of art, the same odd flashes of humor, the same rawness to memory and experience...it's obvious why some readers find a deep, deep correspondence to their own inner lives in [Smith's] work."[12]


Awards

_M Train_ was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[13]
