HIGHGATE PRIVATE HOSPITAL, in View Road, Highgate is run by Aspen Healthcare, a subsidiary of United Surgical Partners International.


History

The hospital was established in 1988.[1] The building was acquired by Health Care REIT, Inc. in 2015 along with Aspen Healthcare’s three other London hospitals for £226 million and leased back to Aspen on a 25-year lease.[2]

The hospital featured in a reported legal case in tort, Batt v Highgate Private Hospital [2004] which established that a widower could not recover damages in respect of the cost of the cosmetic surgery which had resulted in his wife's death at the hospital.[3]

It was expanded during 2015 at a cost of £13 million to provide 43 en-suite patient rooms, a High Dependency Unit, four operating theatres, an Endoscopy Suite, Physiotherapy Suite, 15 outpatient rooms, and a private GP service.[4] Neurosurgery services were expanded in 2013 with the recruitment of consultant neurosurgeon Mary Murphy.[5]

The hospital director is Mark Lyons, formerly an anaesthetic practitioner in the NHS.[6]
