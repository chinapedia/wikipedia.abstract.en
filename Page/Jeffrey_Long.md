Biography

Long completed medical school and a residency in radiation oncology at the University of Iowa.[1] Early in his medical career, Long became interested in NDEs after reading a journal article about them. A few years later, the wife of one of his friends told him a detailed story about her experience after her heart stopped while under anesthesia. While working as a physician in Las Vegas, Long was influenced by speakers who had been invited by Raymond Moody, a physician and NDE researcher.[2]

He later practiced medicine in Gallup, New Mexico, before taking a position at the Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center in Houma, Louisiana, in 2009.[3] Long established the Near Death Experience Research Foundation (NDERF) in 1998.[4][5][6][7] The foundation maintains a website, also launched in 1998, and a database of more than 1,600 cases, which is the world's largest collection of near-death reports.[8] He is on the board of directors of the American Center for the Integration of Spiritually Transformative Experiences (ACISTE).[9]

Long's data has helped to characterized the experiences of people who felt that they experienced NDEs. For example, after examining the experiences of more than 1,100 patients, he said that 74% of them experienced a heightened sense of consciousness or awareness during what they described as an NDE.[10] He said that _peace_ and _love_ are the two words most commonly used by people who describe what they believe to be NDEs.[11] In 2014, the NDERF said that an average of 774 NDEs happened each day in the United States.[12]

Long is the author of the book _Evidence of the Afterlife: The Science of Near-Death Experiences_, a _New York Times_ Best Seller.[13] He has appeared in many media outlets, including _The O'Reilly Factor_, _NBC Today_, ABC (Peter Jennings), _Dr. Oz Show_, History Channel, Learning Channel, National Geographic and Fox News Houston.[14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21]

In 2009 Long contributed to _The handbook of near-death experiences: thirty years of investigation_, published by Praeger. The book is a comprehensive critical review of the research carried out within the field of near-death studies and considered to be a relevant publication in the field.[22][23][24]
