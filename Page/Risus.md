_RISUS: THE ANYTHING RPG_ is a rules-light generic role-playing game (RPG) written, designed and illustrated by S. John Ross of Cumberland Games and Diversions.[1][2][3] _Risus_ is available free on the web. It was first published online in 1993. Earlier versions of the game were titled _GUCS: THE GENERIC UNIVERSAL COMEDY SYSTEM_ (a parody of _GURPS_) and were distributed privately beginning in 1989.


History

_Risus_ (Latin for “laughter”) is a comedy game[4] (often described by its creator as a "joke game") and uses a cliché (character class) system[5] inspired by the broad "career scale" skills in Greg Gorden's _DC Heroes RPG_ (Mayfair Games), and later influenced by Atlas Games' _Over the Edge_. The core systems of _Risus_ owe their largest debt to the _Ghostbusters RPG_ published by West End Games, and to _Tunnels and Trolls_ by Ken St. Andre. The game itself also cites _GURPS_ as an influence, along with _FUDGE_, another free RPG released to the web a year earlier. Several more recent games have been, in turn, influenced by _Risus._

Despite the game's small size and admittedly joking nature, there are more than 30 fan-authored websites devoted to _Risus,_ some including several rules variants, simple worldbooks, and wholly rewritten adaptations of the game. _Risus_ itself has been translated into Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.[6] In December, 2003, Cumberland Games began to support the free game with commercial supplements, beginning with the _Risus Companion_ and the founding of the International Order of Risus. An example of another commercial product is _A Kringle in Time_, "an adventure about saving Christmas from ancient evil."[7]

_New Risus_ won the 2001 inaugural RPGnet award for _Best Free RPG_.[8]


_Risus Companion_

_The Risus Companion_ is the first commercial supplement of _Risus_. S. John Ross wrote and published[9] the _Risus Companion_ on the 10th anniversary of _Risus_ on the World Wide Web, in order to provide a foundation for _Risus_ as a commercial venture. _Risus_ itself remains free of charge, allowing _Risus_ fans the option to support _Risus_ if they choose and be materially rewarded for doing so. The _Risus Companion_ is an electronic document in PDF form, made available to all members of the International Order of Risus.


International Order of Risus

The INTERNATIONAL ORDER OF RISUS is the official fan club of _Risus_. The Order is, according to their own charter, dedicated to promoting _Risus_ and to "imposing our iron will upon an unsuspecting universe."
