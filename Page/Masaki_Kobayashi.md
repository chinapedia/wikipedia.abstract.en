was a Japanese film director, best known for the epic trilogy _The Human Condition_ (1959–1961), the samurai films _Harakiri_ (1962) and _Samurai Rebellion_ (1967), and _Kwaidan_ (1964).[1]


Biography

Kobayashi was a second cousin of the actress and director Kinuyo Tanaka.[2]

Early life

Kobayashi studied East Asian art and philosophy. He embarked on a career in film in 1941 when he entered Shochiku Studios as an apprentice director, but was immediately drafted into the Imperial Japanese Army and sent to Manchuria.[3]

Kobayashi regarded himself as a pacifist, and resisted by refusing promotion to a rank higher than private.[4] He spent time as a prisoner of war in an Okinawa camp. After his release, in 1946, he returned to Shochiku as assistant to the director Keisuke Kinoshita.[5]

Films

Kobayashi's directorial debut was in 1952 with _Musuko no Seishun_ (_My Son's Youth_).

From 1959 to 1961, Kobayashi directed _The Human Condition_ (1959–1961), a trilogy on the effects of World War II on a Japanese pacifist and socialist. The total length of the films is almost ten hours, and one of the longest fiction films ever made for theatrical release.[6]

In 1962 he directed _Harakiri_, which won the Jury Prize at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival.

In 1964, Kobayashi made _Kwaidan_ (1964), his first color film, a collection of four ghost stories drawn from books by Lafcadio Hearn. Kwaidan won the Special Jury Prize at the 1965 Cannes Film Festival,[7] and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film.[8]

In 1968, Akira Kurosawa, Keisuke Kinoshita, Kon Ichikawa and Kobayashi founded the directors group, _Shiki no kai_-_The Four Horsemen Club_, in an attempt to create movies for younger generations.[9][10]

In 1969, he was a member of the jury at the 19th Berlin International Film Festival.[11]

He was also a candidate for directing the Japanese sequences for _Tora! Tora! Tora!_ after Akira Kurosawa left the film. But instead Kinji Fukasaku and Toshio Masuda were chosen.

One of his grand projects was a film on Yasushi Inoue's novel about Buddhist China, _Tun Huang_, which never came to fruition.[12]
