SANKT BARBARA IM MÜRZTAL is since 2015 a market town in Styria, Austria, with 6,726 inhabitants (as of 1 January 2016) in the judicial district of Mürzzuschlag and in the political district of Bruck-Mürzzuschlag in Styria. As part of the municipality structural reform in Styria, the municipality, which was founded on 1 January 2015, was formed by the merger of the independent municipalities:

-   Mitterdorf im Mürztal,
-   Veitsch und
-   Wartberg im Mürztal.

This was based on the Styrian municipality Structural Reform Act, StGsrG.[1][2]

In this case, no major part of one of the (three) outlying communities was used as a new name, but only the district name "Mürztal" (Murtal). The new community is named after the patron saint of miners, St. Barbara. A church dedicated to St. Barbara was built in 1986 in what is now the district Mitterdorf.[3]
