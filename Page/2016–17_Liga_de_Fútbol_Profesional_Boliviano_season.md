The 2016–17 LIGA DE FÚTBOL PROFESIONAL BOLIVIANO SEASON was the 40th season of Bolivia's top-flight football league and the last season under the LFPB name. This season comprised three tournaments (_Apertura 2016_, _Apertura 2017_ and _Clausura 2017_) after an agreement was reached between LFPB and ANF (Second Division) to change the calendar to a single calendar year following the reforms implemented for the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana by CONMEBOL ahead of the 2017 season.


Teams

The number of teams for 2016–17 remained the same as last season. Ciclón was relegated to the Liga Nacional B (Second Division). They were replaced by the 2015–16 Liga Nacional B champion Guabirá.

Aggregate table playoff decider

Since Petrolero and Universitario ended the season tied in points, a match on neutral ground was played to determine the team that played the promotion/relegation playoff. The loser qualified for the promotion/relegation playoff.


Relegation/promotion playoff

The relegation playoff was played between:

-   Petrolero (2016–17 Primera División aggregate table 12th place)
-   Destroyers (2016–17 Liga Nacional B runners-up)

The winner played in the top flight for the 2018 season.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Destroyers won on points (4–1) and was promoted to the Primera División._
