LEVONORGESTREL BUTANOATE (LNG-B) (developmental code name HRP-002),[1][2] or LEVONORGESTREL 17Β-BUTANOATE, is a steroidal progestin of the 19-nortestosterone group which was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the Contraceptive Development Branch (CDB) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development as a long-acting injectable contraceptive.[3][4][5] It is the C17β butanoate ester of levonorgestrel, and acts as a prodrug of levonorgestrel in the body.[6] The drug is at or beyond the phase III stage of clinical development, but has not been marketed at this time.[7] It was first described in the literature, by the WHO, in 1983, and has been under investigation for potential clinical use since then.[8][9]

LNG-B has been under investigation as a long-lasting injectable contraceptive for women.[10] A single intramuscular injection of an aqueous suspension of 5 or 10 mg LNG-B has a duration of 3 months,[11][12] whereas an injection of 50 mg has a duration of 6 months.[13] The drug was also previously tested successfully as a combined injectable contraceptive with estradiol hexahydrobenzoate, but this formulation was never marketed.[14] LNG-B has been tested successfully in combination with testosterone buciclate as a long-lasting injectable contraceptive for men as well.[15][16]

LNG-B may have several advantages over depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, including the use of much lower comparative dosages, reduced progestogenic side effects like hypogonadism and amenorrhea, and a more rapid return in fertility following discontinuation.[17][18] The drug has a well-established safety record owing to the use of levonorgestrel as an oral contraceptive since the 1960s.[19]
