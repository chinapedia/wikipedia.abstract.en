THE COMPANY (stylized as THE COMPANY) is a vocal group based in the Philippines. Its current members are Moy Ortiz, Annie Quintos, Sweet Plantado and OJ Mariano.


History

The original members of The CompanY were former members of the 1981 and 1983 touring batches of Ateneo College Glee Club (from Ateneo de Manila University). Their musical director, Moy Ortiz, named the group after Stephen Sondheim's musical _Company_. The new group focused on contemporary jazz and a cappella music, instead of songs from the classical and traditional choral that they performed under the ACGC.[1]

The CompanY scored their first hit with the single _Everlasting Love_, which Ortiz co-wrote with Luigi De Dios and Rina Caniza.[2]

This was followed in 1992 by two other hits,_“Muntik na Kitang Minamal_ (_"I almost loved you"_) and “Now That I Have You,” from their second album _Sixby6_. That same year, The CompanY performed at their major concert with the Manhattan Transfer at the Araneta Coliseum[3]

In 2014, The Company welcomed OJ Mariano as their newest member, replacing Jay Marquez.[4]
