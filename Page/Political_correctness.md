The term POLITICAL CORRECTNESS (adjectivally: POLITICALLY CORRECT; commonly abbreviated PC) is used to describe language, policies, or measures that are intended to avoid offense or disadvantage to members of particular groups in society.For definitions, see:

-   -   -   [1][2][3][4] Since the late 1980s, the term has come to refer to a preference for inclusive language and avoiding language or behavior that can be seen as excluding, marginalizing, or insulting groups of people considered disadvantaged or discriminated against, especially groups defined by sex or race. In public discourse and the media, it is generally used as a pejorative, implying that these policies are excessive or unwarranted.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11]

While earlier usage of the term referred to the strict adherence to political orthodoxy, the contemporary pejorative usage of the term emerged from conservative criticism of the New Left in the late 20th century. This usage was popularized by a number of articles in _The New York Times_ and other media throughout the 1990s,[12][13][14][15][16][17] and was widely used in the debate about Allan Bloom's 1987 book _The Closing of the American Mind_,[18][19][20][21] and gained further currency in response to Roger Kimball's _Tenured Radicals_ (1990),[22][23][24][25] and conservative author Dinesh D'Souza's 1991 book _Illiberal Education_ in which he condemned what he saw as liberal efforts to advance self-victimization and multiculturalism through language, affirmative action, and changes to the content of school and university curricula.[26][27][28][29]

Commentators on the political left in the United States contend that conservatives use the concept of political correctness to downplay and divert attention from substantively discriminatory behavior against disadvantaged groups.[30][31][32] They also argue that the political right enforces its own forms of political correctness to suppress criticism of its favored constituencies and ideologies.[33][34][35] In the United States, the term has played a major role in the "culture war" between liberals and conservatives.[36]


History

The term "politically correct" was used infrequently until the latter part of the 20th century. This earlier use did not communicate the social disapproval usually implied in more recent usage. In 1793, the term "politically correct" appeared in a U.S. Supreme Court judgment of a political lawsuit.[37] The term also had use in other English-speaking countries in the 1800s.For two examples see:

-   -   William Safire states that the first recorded use of the term in the typical modern sense is by Toni Cade Bambara in the 1970 anthology _The Black Woman_.[38] The term probably entered modern use in the United Kingdom around 1975.[39]

Early-to-mid 20th century

In the early-to-mid 20th century, the phrase "politically correct" was used to describe strict adherence to a range of ideological orthodoxies. In 1934, _The New York Times_ reported that Nazi Germany was granting reporting permits "only to pure 'Aryans' whose opinions are politically correct."[40]

As Marxist-Leninist movements gained political power, the phrase came to be associated with accusations of dogmatic application of doctrine, in debates between American Communists and American Socialists. This usage referred to the Communist party line which, in the eyes of the Socialists, provided "correct" positions on all political matters. According to American educator Herbert Kohl, writing about debates in New York in the late 1940s and early 1950s,

1970s

In the 1970s, the American New Left began using the term "politically correct".[41] In the essay _The Black Woman: An Anthology_ (1970), Toni Cade Bambara said that "a man cannot be politically correct and a [[chauvinism#Male_chauvinism|[male] chauvinist]], too." Thereafter, the term was often used as self-critical satire. Debra L. Shultz said that "throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the New Left, feminists, and progressives... used their term 'politically correct' ironically, as a guard against their own orthodoxy in social change efforts."[42][43][44] _PC_ is used in the comic book _Merton of the Movement_, by Bobby London, which was followed by the term _ideologically sound_, in the comic strips of Bart Dickon.[45][46] In her essay "Toward a feminist Revolution" (1992) Ellen Willis said: "In the early eighties, when feminists used the term 'political correctness', it was used to refer sarcastically to the anti-pornography movement's efforts to define a 'feminist sexuality'."[47]

Stuart Hall suggests one way in which the original use of the term may have developed into the modern one:

1980s and 1990s

Allan Bloom's 1987 book _The Closing of the American Mind_[48] heralded a debate about "political correctness" in American higher education in the 1980s and 1990s.[49][50][51][52] Professor of English literary and cultural studies at CMU Jeffrey J. Williams wrote that the "assault on ... political correctness that simmered through the Reagan years, gained bestsellerdom with Bloom's Closing of the American Mind."[53] According to Z.F. Gamson, Bloom's book "attacked the faculty for 'political correctness'."[54] Prof. of Social Work at CSU Tony Platt says the "campaign against 'political correctness'" was launched by Bloom's book in 1987.[55]

An October 1990 _New York Times_ article by Richard Bernstein is credited with popularizing the term.[56][57][58][59][60] At this time, the term was mainly being used within academia: "Across the country the term p.c., as it is commonly abbreviated, is being heard more and more in debates over what should be taught at the universities".[61] Nexis citations in "arcnews/curnews" reveal only seventy total citations in articles to "political correctness" for 1990; but one year later, Nexis records 1,532 citations, with a steady increase to more than 7,000 citations by 1994.[62][63] In May 1991, _The New York Times_ had a follow-up article, according to which the term was increasingly being used in a wider public arena:

The previously obscure far-left term became common currency in the lexicon of the conservative social and political challenges against progressive teaching methods and curriculum changes in the secondary schools and universities of the U.S.[64][65][66][67][68][69] Policies, behavior, and speech codes that the speaker or the writer regarded as being the imposition of a liberal orthodoxy, were described and criticized as "politically correct".[70] In May 1991, at a commencement ceremony for a graduating class of the University of Michigan, then U.S. President George H.W. Bush used the term in his speech: "The notion of political correctness has ignited controversy across the land. And although the movement arises from the laudable desire to sweep away the debris of racism and sexism and hatred, it replaces old prejudice with new ones. It declares certain topics off-limits, certain expression off-limits, even certain gestures off-limits."See:

-   -

After 1991, its use as a pejorative phrase became widespread amongst conservatives in the US.[71] It became a key term encapsulating conservative concerns about the left in culture and political debate more broadly, as well as in academia. Two articles on the topic in late 1990 in _Forbes_ and _Newsweek_ both used the term "thought police" in their headlines, exemplifying the tone of the new usage, but it was Dinesh D'Souza's _Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus_ (1991) which "captured the press's imagination."[72] Similar critical terminology was used by D'Souza for a range of policies in academia around victimization, supporting multiculturalism through affirmative action, sanctions against anti-minority hate speech, and revising curricula (sometimes referred to as "canon busting").[73][74] These trends were at least in part a response to multiculturalism and the rise of identity politics, with movements such as feminism, gay rights movements and ethnic minority movements. That response received funding from conservative foundations and think tanks such as the John M. Olin Foundation, which funded several books such as D'Souza's.[75][76]

Herbert Kohl, in 1992, commented that a number of neoconservatives who promoted the use of the term "politically correct" in the early 1990s were former Communist Party members, and, as a result, familiar with the Marxist use of the phrase. He argued that in doing so, they intended "to insinuate that egalitarian democratic ideas are actually authoritarian, orthodox, and Communist-influenced, when they oppose the right of people to be racist, sexist, and homophobic."[77]

During the 1990s, conservative and right-wing politicians, think-tanks, and speakers adopted the phrase as a pejorative descriptor of their ideological enemies – especially in the context of the Culture Wars about language and the content of public-school curricula. Roger Kimball, in _Tenured Radicals_, endorsed Frederick Crews's view that PC is best described as "Left Eclecticism", a term defined by Kimball as "any of a wide variety of anti-establishment modes of thought from structuralism and poststructuralism, deconstruction, and Lacanian analyst to feminist, homosexual, black, and other patently political forms of criticism."[78][79]

Liberal commentators have argued that the conservatives and reactionaries who used the term did so in effort to divert political discussion away from the substantive matters of resolving societal discrimination – such as racial, social class, gender, and legal inequality – against people whom conservatives do not consider part of the social mainstream.[80][81]For commentary see:

-   -   -   -   -   Jan Narveson wrote that "that phrase was born to live between scare-quotes: it suggests that the operative considerations in the area so called are _merely_ political, steamrolling the genuine reasons of principle for which we ought to be acting..."[82] Commenting in 2001, one such British journalist,[83][84] Polly Toynbee, said "the phrase is an empty, right-wing smear, designed only to elevate its user", and, in 2010, "the phrase 'political correctness' was born as a coded cover for all who still want to say _Paki_, _spastic_, or _queer_".For Polly Toynbee see:

Modern usage

Education

Much of the modern debate on the term was sparked by conservative critiques of liberal bias in academia and education,[85] and conservatives have since used it as a major line of attack.[86] University of Pennsylvania professor Alan Charles Kors and lawyer Harvey A. Silverglate connect speech codes in US universities to Frankfurt School philosopher Herbert Marcuse. They claim that speech codes create a "climate of repression", arguing that they are based on "Marcusean logic". The speech codes, "mandate a redefined notion of "freedom", based on the belief that the imposition of a moral agenda on a community is justified", a view which, "requires less emphasis on individual rights and more on assuring "historically oppressed" persons the means of achieving equal rights."[87] Kors and Silverglate later established the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), which campaigns against infringement of rights of due process, in particular "speech codes".[88]

Similarly, a common conservative criticism of higher education in the United States is that the political views of the faculty are much more liberal than the general population, and that this situation contributes to an atmosphere of political correctness.[89] William Deresiewicz argues that political correctness largely functions as a sort of religious dogma on college campuses and while it may have some noble goals, it is largely about power, censoring its opponents to ensure the dogma cannot be questioned, resulting in censorship and self-censorship of those who disagree. This also results in its tenets being applied inconsistently - Deresiewicz argues that while it ostensibly opposes prejudice, its proponents will hurl prejudicial insults against demographics they hold in contempt. Deresiewicz also argues that political correctness is largely the result of for-profit education, as campus faculty and staff are wary of angering students upon whose fees they depend. Deresiewicz also observes that political correctness on campuses largely ignores issues of social class, which he suggests is due to the fact that most of its adherents come from economically privileged backgrounds.[90]

As a conspiracy theory

Some conservative commentators in the West argue that "political correctness" and multiculturalism are part of a conspiracy with the ultimate goal of undermining Judeo-Christian values. This theory, which holds that political correctness originates from the critical theory of the Frankfurt School as part of a conspiracy that its proponents call "Cultural Marxism", is generally known as the Frankfurt School conspiracy theory by academics.For Cultural Marxism, see:

-   -   The theory originated with Michael Minnicino's 1992 essay "New Dark Age: Frankfurt School and 'Political Correctness'", published in a Lyndon LaRouche movement journal.[91] In 2001, conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan wrote in _The Death of the West_ that "political correctness is cultural Marxism", and that "its trademark is intolerance".[92]

Media

In the US, the term has been widely used in books and journals, but in Britain, usage has been confined mainly to the popular press.[93] Many such authors and popular-media figures, particularly on the right, have used the term to criticize what they see as bias in the media.[94][95] William McGowan argues that journalists get stories wrong or ignore stories worthy of coverage, because of what McGowan perceives to be their liberal ideologies and their fear of offending minority groups.[96] Robert Novak, in his essay "Political Correctness Has No Place in the Newsroom", used the term to blame newspapers for adopting language use policies that he thinks tend to excessively avoid the appearance of bias. He argued that political correctness in language not only destroys meaning but also demeans the people who are meant to be protected.See:

-   -   -   Authors David Sloan and Emily Hoff claim that in the US, journalists shrug off concerns about political correctness in the newsroom, equating the political correctness criticisms with the old "liberal media bias" label.[97]

Satirical use

Political correctness is often satirized, for example in _The PC Manifesto_ (1992) by Saul Jerushalmy and Rens Zbignieuw X,[98] and _Politically Correct Bedtime Stories_ (1994) by James Finn Garner, which presents fairy tales re-written from an exaggerated politically correct perspective. In 1994, the comedy film _PCU_ took a look at political correctness on a college campus.

Other examples include the television program _Politically Incorrect_, George Carlin’s "Euphemisms" routine, and _The Politically Correct Scrapbook_.[99] The popularity of the _South Park_ cartoon program led to the creation of the term "_South Park_ Republican" by Andrew Sullivan, and later the book _South Park Conservatives_ by Brian C. Anderson.[100] In its Season 19 (2015), _South Park_ introduced the character PC Principal, who embodies the principle, to poke fun at the principle of political correctness.For _South Park's_ usage see:

-   -   -

_The Colbert Report_'s host Stephen Colbert often talked, satirically, about the "PC Police".For Colbert's usage see:

-   -

Science

Groups who oppose certain generally accepted scientific views about evolution, second-hand tobacco smoke, AIDS, global warming, race, and other politically contentious scientific matters have used the term "political correctness" to describe what they view as unwarranted rejection of their perspective on these issues by a scientific community they feel is corrupted by liberal politics.[101]


Usage in selected regions

Australia

In 2004, then Australian Labor leader Mark Latham described conservative calls for "civility" in politics as "the new political correctness."[102]

Canada

Graham Good, an academic at the University of British Columbia, wrote that the term was widely used in debates on university education in Canada. Writing about a 1995 report on the Political Science department at his university, he concluded: "'Political correctness' has become a popular phrase because it catches a certain kind of self-righteous and judgmental tone in some and a pervasive anxiety in others – who, fearing that they may do something wrong, adjust their facial expressions, and pause in their speech to make sure they are not doing or saying anything inappropriate. The climate this has created on campuses is at least as bad in Canada as in the United States."[103]

Hong Kong

In Hong Kong, as the 1997 handover drew nearer, greater control over the press was exercised by both owners and the Chinese state. This had a direct impact on news coverage of relatively sensitive political issues. The Chinese authorities exerted pressure on individual newspapers to take pro-Beijing stances on controversial issues.For information on Hong Kong see:

-   -   -   Tung Chee-hwa's policy advisers and senior bureaucrats increasingly linked their actions and remarks to "political correctness." Zhaojia Liu and Siu-kai Lau, writing in _The first Tung Chee-hwa administration : the first five years of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region_, said that "Hong Kong has traditionally been characterized as having freedom of speech and freedom of the press, but that an unintended consequence of emphasizing political 'correctness' is to limit the space for such freedom of expression."[104]

New Zealand

In New Zealand, controversies over PC surfaced during the 1990s regarding the social studies school curriculum.[105][106]

United States

Conservative political correctness

"Political correctness" is a label typically used to describe liberal terms and actions, but not for equivalent attempts to mold language and behavior on the right.[107] However, the term "right-wing political correctness" is sometimes applied by commentators,For commentators see:

-   -   -   -   especially when drawing parallels: in 1995, one author used the term "conservative correctness" arguing, in relation to higher education, that "critics of political correctness show a curious blindness when it comes to examples of conservative correctness. Most often, the case is entirely ignored or censorship of the Left is justified as a positive virtue. [...] A balanced perspective was lost, and everyone missed the fact that people on all sides were sometimes censored."[108]

In 2003, french fries and french toast were renamed "freedom fries" and "freedom toast" in three U.S. House of Representatives cafeterias in response to France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq; this was described as "polluting the already confused concept of political correctness."Regarding the fries and toast, see:

-   -

In 2012, Paul Krugman wrote: "the big threat to our discourse is right-wing political correctness, which – unlike the liberal version – has lots of power and money behind it. And the goal is very much the kind of thing Orwell tried to convey with his notion of "Newspeak": to make it impossible to talk, and possibly even think, about ideas that challenge the established order."[109]

After Mike Pence was booed at a November 2016 performance of Hamilton, president-elect Trump called it harassment and asked for a "safe and special place".Regarding Pence and Trump see:

-   -   -   -   -   -   Chrissy Teigen commented that it was "the very thing him and his supporters make fun of as liberal political correctness."For Chrissy Teigen see:

-   -   -   -

Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute defined the right's own version of political correctness as "patriotic correctness".[110] Vox editor Dara Lind summarized the definition as "a brand of right-wing hypersensitivity that gets just as offended by insults to American pride and patriotism (like protests against the president-elect or "The Star-Spangled Banner") as any college activist gets over insults to diversity."[111] Jim Geraghty of _National Review_ replied to Nowrasteh, stating that "There is no right-wing equivalent to political correctness" as, in modern America, conservatives "don't have much ability to actually punish anyone for their views."[112]

2016 United States presidential election

In 2015 and 2016, leading up to the 2016 United States presidential election, Republican candidate Donald Trump criticized political correctness often in his rhetoric.[113][114][115] According to Trump, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were willing to let ordinary Americans suffer because their first priority was political correctness.[116]

In _the Huffington Post_, Eric Mink characterized Trump's concept of "political correctness":

  Political correctness is a controversial social force in a nation with a constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression, and it raises legitimate issues well worth discussing and debating. But that’s not what Trump is doing. He’s not a rebel speaking unpopular truths to power. He’s not standing up for honest discussions of deeply contentious issues. He’s not out there defying rules handed down by elites to control what we say. All Trump’s defying is common decency.[117]

Following the 2016 election, _Los Angeles Times_ columnist Jessica Roy wrote that "political correctness" is one of the key terms used by the American alt-right, who refer to it as being "responsible for most of society's ills".[118]


False accusations

According to author John Wilson, left-wing forces of "political correctness" have been blamed for unrelated censorship, with _Time_ citing campaigns against violence on network television in the US as contributing to a "mainstream culture [which] has become cautious, sanitized, scared of its own shadow" because of "the watchful eye of the p.c. police", protests and advertiser boycotts targeting TV shows are generally organized by right-wing religious groups campaigning against violence, sex, and depictions of homosexuality on television.[119]

In the United Kingdom, some newspapers reported that a nursery school had altered the nursery rhyme "Baa Baa Black Sheep" to read "Baa Baa Rainbow Sheep" and had banned the original.[120] But it was later reported that in fact the Parents and Children Together (PACT) nursery had the children "turn the song into an action rhyme.... They sing happy, sad, bouncing, hopping, pink, blue, black and white sheep etc."[121] This story was widely circulated and later extended to suggest that other language bans applied to the terms "black coffee" and "blackboard".[122] _Private Eye_ magazine reported that similar stories had been published in the British press since _The Sun_ first ran them in 1986.[123]
