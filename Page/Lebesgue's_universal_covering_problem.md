LEBESGUE'S UNIVERSAL COVERING PROBLEM is an unsolved problem in geometry that asks for the convex shape of smallest area that can cover any planar set of diameter one. The diameter of a set by definition is the least upper bound of the distances between all pairs of points in the set. A shape covers a set if it contains a congruent subset. In other words the set may be rotated, translated or reflected to fit inside the shape. The problem was posed by Henri Lebesgue in a letter to Gyula Pál in 1914. It was published in a paper by Pál in 1920 along with Pál's analysis.[1] He showed that a cover for all curves of constant width one is also a cover for all sets of diameter one and that a cover can be constructed by taking a regular hexagon with an inscribed circle of diameter one and removing two corners from the hexagon to give a cover of area $2 - \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 0.84529946$.

Known bounds

In 1936 Roland Sprague showed that a part of Pál's cover could be removed near one of the other corners while still retaining its property as a cover.[2] This reduced the upper bound on the area to a ≤ 0.844137708436. In 1992 Hansen showed that two more very small regions of Sprague's solution could be removed bringing the upper bound down to a ≤ 0.844137708398. Hansen's construction was the first to make use of the freedom to use reflections.[3] In 2015 John Baez, Karine Bagdasaryan and Philip Gibbs showed that if the corners removed in Pál's cover are cut off at a different angle then it is possible to reduce the area further giving an upper bound of a ≤ 0.8441153.[4] In October 2018 Philip Gibbs published a paper on arXiv using high-school geometry and claiming a further reduction to 0.8440935944.{{ cite arXiv

The best known lower bound for the area was provided by Peter Brass and Mehrbod Sharifi using a combination of three shapes in optimal alignment giving a ≥ 0.832.[6]
