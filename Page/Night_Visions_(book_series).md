_NIGHT VISIONS_ is an American anthology of horror stories published 1984-1991 by Dark Harvest of Arlington Heights, IL. The science fiction bibliographer and scholar Neil Barron wrote that Night Visions is an important series insofar as many of the stories it published represented some of the best short fiction produced by its writers, and that "it is a cornerstone of any modern horror library."[1][2]

Insofar as many of the stories it published represented some of the best short fiction produced by those writers, it is a cornerstone of any modern horror library." ...and featuring 14 stories by Thomas Tessier (his novella "The Dreams of Dr. Ladybank"), James Kisner, and Rick Hautala.
