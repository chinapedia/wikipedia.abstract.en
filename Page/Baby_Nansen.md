BIRTHONY KATARINA NANSEN[1] (born 11 January 1987), better known as BABY NANSEN, is a New Zealand professional boxer and a retired kickboxer of Samoan descent.[2] Nansen's biggest fight of her career was against Melissa St. Vil for the vacant WBC Silver female super featherweight title on the Kali Reis vs. Maricela Cornejo undercard.[3] Despite losing the bout, she fought very well and received a WBC ranking of 39th. Nansen has fought on a King in the Ring undercard.


Vs Jennings

In 2016, Nansen was appointed as the number one contender for the New Zealand National (NZPBA Version) Super Featherweight Title, which was then held by Rebecca Jennings.[4] The two fought each other in May 2017 for the NZPBA title with the winner originally being Nansen by Split Decision. Shortly after the bout, Nansen's camp were approached by the officiating supervisor and it was revealed the scorecard calculations were added up incorrectly. Nansen was stripped of the title immediately and the result was changed to a draw from the right calculations.[5]
