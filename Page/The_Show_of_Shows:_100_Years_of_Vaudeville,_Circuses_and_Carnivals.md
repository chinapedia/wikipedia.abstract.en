It has an original soundtrack by members of Sigur Rós and the composer Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson, and was commissioned by BBC Storyville and BBC North .


The film

The archive which provided the footage is held at the University of Sheffield. For the film, it provided home movies from circus families, moving images of clowns, acrobats, the high wire, human cannonballs and escapologists. Cabaret acts, fairground attractions, variety performances, music hall and seaside entertainments are all part of the fabric of the film. Scenes of animals and children performing for entertainment show how times and attitudes have changed.[1][2]

The film premiered by opening Sheffield Doc/Fest, and was screened at San Sebastián International Film Festival and Sarajevo Film Festival.[3] It was shown on BBC Four on 17 January 2016 as _The Golden Age of Circus: The Show of Shows_.[4]
