Legend

Legend has it that this temple was built by one of the Maharajas of Mysore many centuries ago. The then Maharaja of Mysore was on his way to visit his uncle who was suffering from eye disease. It came to his notice that there were devotees frequenting an Anthill at the present site of the temple. The Maharaja visited the anthill and prayed that if his uncle is cured of the eye disease, he would build a temple at the site for the Lord. Once the Maharaja reached Mysore, it was brought to his notice that his uncle was cured of the eye disease. The temple was constructed to thank the Lord as a votive offering.

There is a sculpture of sage Mandavya in the Mantapam. As per one of the versions, Sage Mandavya had this temple built on being directed by the Lord. Some are of the opinion that this temple was built around the same time Sri Someshwara temple was built due to its connection with Sage Mandavya.
