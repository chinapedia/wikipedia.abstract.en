_THE FOURTH DIMENSION IN SOUND_ (subtitled _A MUSICAL EXPERIMENT IN THE ADAPTATION OF INSTRUMENTS TO MODERN ELECTRONICS_) is an album by bandleader and arranger Shorty Rogers recorded in late 1961 and released on the Warner Bros. label.[1][2] The album was produced principally as a stereo test and demonstration record to be used by hi-fi enthusiasts to test the performance of their audio systems.


Reception

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow states: "As was true of many records from the early 1960's, the emphasis on this out-of-print Lp (especially in the lengthy liner notes) is on the stereophonic sound rather than the music. ... The music is better than the liner notes (which spend most of their time describing the sound) lets on but is not all that significant, emphasizing swing standards along with an occasional Latin novelty."[3]
