AMARSHI KASBA is a census town in Patashpur I CD block in Egra subdivision of Purba Medinipur district in the state of West Bengal, India.


History

Binoy Ghosh notes that during the Muslim rule, the word ‘Kasba’, meaning human settlement, was attached to the names of many villages. Kasba-i-Amarshi was one of them. There is a popular folklore about the place. There was once a king named Amar Singh. He was very oppressive and did not even treat his subjects as human beings. He also was a Muslim-hater. At the entrance gate of his palace, a footwear of his was hung, the objective being that visitors to the palace would first show respect to the footwear and then enter the palace. Towards the end of the 17th century, Makdum Saheb of the Chishti Order was visiting Bengal. One day, he came to visit the king, and as usual was asked to show respect to the footwear hung at the gate. He refused and a fight ensued, in which not only the guards, but also the king was killed. The news of Makdum Saheb’s bravery spread fast and the oppressed subjects felt relieved.[1]
