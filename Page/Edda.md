"EDDA" (; Old Norse _Edda_, plural _Eddur_) is an Old Norse term that has been attributed by modern scholars to the collective of two Medieval Icelandic literary works: what is now known as the _Prose Edda_ and an older collection of poems without an original title now known as the _Poetic Edda_. The term historically referred only to the _Prose Edda_, but this since has fallen out of use because of the confusion with the other work. Both works were written down in Iceland during the 13th century in Icelandic, although they contain material from earlier traditional sources, reaching into the Viking Age. The books are the main sources of medieval skaldic tradition in Iceland and Norse mythology.


Etymology

There are several hypotheses concerning the origins of the word _edda_. One hypothesis holds that it is identical to a word that means "great-grandmother" appearing in the Eddic poem _Rígsþula._[1] Another hypothesis holds that _edda_ derives from Old Norse _óðr_, "poetry". A third, proposed in 1895 by Eiríkr Magnússon, is that it derives from the Icelandic place name _Oddi_, site of the church and school where students, including Snorri Sturluson, were educated.[2] A fourth hypothesis—the derivation of the word _Edda_ as the name of Snorri Sturluson’s treatise on poetry from the Latin _edo_, "I compose (poetry)", by analogy with _kredda_, "superstition", from Latin _credo_, "creed"—is now widely accepted, though this acceptance may stem from its agreement with modern usage rather than historical accuracy.[3] The fifth hypothesis based on the fact that there was a fashion of giving Icelandic manuscripts bird titles. (Such are the legal codes _Grágás_ ‘grey goose’, _Gullfjǫðr_ ‘gold feather (quill?)’, and _Hryggjar-stykki_ ‘a kind of duck’.) Perhaps Edda was also one of such titles: _Edda_ would be an appropriate ‘pet name’ of _æðr_ (pronounced as [æ:ðr] f.) ‘eider duck’. Then, _Edda_ meant ‘little eider duck’ (an analog of _Grágás_).[4]


The _Poetic Edda_

The _Poetic Edda_, also known as _Sæmundar Edda_ or the _Elder Edda_, is a collection of Old Norse poems from the Icelandic medieval manuscript Codex Regius ("Royal Book"). Along with the _Prose Edda_, the _Poetic Edda_ is the most expansive source on Norse mythology. The first part of the Codex Regius preserves poems that narrate the creation and foretold destruction and rebirth of the Old Norse mythological world as well as individual myths about gods concerning Norse deities. The poems in the second part narrate legends about Norse heroes and heroines, such as Sigurd, Brynhildr and Gunnar.

The Codex Regius was written in the 13th century, but nothing is known of its whereabouts until 1643, when it came into the possession of Brynjólfur Sveinsson, then the Church of Iceland's Bishop of Skálholt. At that time, versions of the _Prose Edda_ were well known in Iceland, but scholars speculated that there once was another _Edda_—an _Elder Edda_—which contained the pagan poems Snorri quotes in his book. When the Codex Regius was discovered, it seemed that this speculation had proven correct. Brynjólfur attributed the manuscript to Sæmundr the Learned, a larger-than-life 12th century Icelandic priest. While this attribution is rejected by modern scholars, the name _Sæmundar Edda_ is still sometimes encountered.

Bishop Brynjólfur sent the Codex Regius as a present to King Christian IV of Denmark, hence the name _Codex Regius_. For centuries it was stored in the Royal Library in Copenhagen but in 1971 it was returned to Iceland.


The _Prose Edda_

The _Prose Edda_, sometimes referred to as the _Younger Edda_ or _Snorri's Edda_, is an Icelandic manual of poetics which also contains many mythological stories. Its purpose was to enable Icelandic poets and readers to understand the subtleties of alliterative verse, and to grasp the mythological allusions behind the many _kennings_ that were used in skaldic poetry.

It was written by the Icelandic scholar and historian Snorri Sturluson around 1220. It survives in four known manuscripts and three fragments, written down from about 1300 to about 1600.[5]

The _Prose Edda_ consists of a Prologue and three separate books: _Gylfaginning_, concerning the creation and foretold destruction and rebirth of the Norse mythical world; _Skáldskaparmál_, a dialogue between Ægir, a Norse god connected with the sea, and Bragi, the skaldic god of poetry; and _Háttatal_, a demonstration of verse forms used in Norse mythology.
