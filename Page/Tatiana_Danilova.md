In 2009, she teamed up with Andrei Novoselov. The pair was coached by Inna Utkina in Moscow and represented Russia.[2] They placed 8th at the 2010 Russian Junior Championships and appeared on the ISU Junior Grand Prix series the following season, placing 4th in Austria and 6th in Germany. Competing on the senior level, they won the silver medal at the 2010 Golden Spin of Zagreb.[3]

Danilova was unable to skate for a year following a shoulder operation so she told Novoselov that he could look for another partner.[4] After returning to skating, she performed in ice shows for two years.[5]

In the 2014–15 season, Danilova began competing for Belarus with Mikalai Kamianchuk. Making their debut as a pair, they placed 6th at the CS Golden Spin of Zagreb in December 2014. They won the silver medal at the MNNT Cup in January 2015. They were second at the Belarusian Championships behind Maria Paliakova / Nikita Bochkov.

Danilova/Kamianchuk finished 10th at the 2016 European Championships in Bratislava and 20th at the 2016 World Championships in Boston, coached by Dmitri Kaplun in Minsk.[6]

The pair placed 10th at the 2017 European Championships in Ostrava. They placed 23rd at the 2017 World Championships in Helsinki.
