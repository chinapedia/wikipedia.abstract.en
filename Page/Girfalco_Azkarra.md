The AZKARRA is the first vehicle produced by Canadian company Atelier Girfalco Limit√©e. It is a three-wheel all-electric sports vehicle accommodating two passengers side by side. Production was initially set to begin in 2017 with first deliveries scheduled for the Spring of 2017, but the team has decided to take a step back and insure that the vehicle is ready before launching production.

The unveiling of the Azkarra concept has been announced on November 22, 2016 to be held on December 2, 2016. "It promises to be one of the fastest accelerating cars in production"[1] and "To Give Supercars A Run For Their Money"[2]

The Azkarra was featured during the Ball for the 75th Anniversary of the Montreal International Auto Show, held on October 12, 2017 at La Tohu.
