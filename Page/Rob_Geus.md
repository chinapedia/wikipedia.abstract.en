ROB GEUS (born 15 July 1971, Rotterdam) is a Dutch cook and TV presenter.


De Smaakpolitie

Geus started presenting his programme __ with SBS 6 in 2002. In this show, Geus visits restaurants and checks their kitchens for hygiene and safety. When Geus is convinced that the restaurant meets the hygiene and safety standards, he awards said restaurant with a _Smaakpolitie OK-sticker_. Most times restaurants won't be awarded this sticker, but are given advice how they can improve their hygiene and safety.

Geus advises people every broadcast to use labels on food with an expiration date on it. When visiting restaurants are really lacking in hygiene according to Geus, he awards them with a T-shirt with the text: 'Hier word ik niet vrolijk van' (This doesn't make me happy) printed on it. This is a famous oneliner which Geus has been using since season one. In 2006 Geus recorded a single together with the Gebroeders Ko which used this oneliner.

Geus also presented the programme __ in which he solved problems at holiday destinations.

Geus opened his own pancake restaurant on 4 September 2010, his establishment is located in Maastricht.[1]
