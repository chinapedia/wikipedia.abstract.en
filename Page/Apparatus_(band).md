APPARATUS was an electro-industrial band based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The trio comprised vocalist Blake Barnes, keyboardist D. York and guitarist Sid. They released a sole full-length self-titled album in 1995 before disbanding.


History

Apparatus was formed in Charlotte by Blake Barnes, D. York and Sid. Their melding of guitar, electronics and hip hop beats earned them comparisons to Nine Inch Nails and KMFDM. The band quickly caught the attention of Re-Constriction Records and were signed in 1995.[1]

The band released their self-titled debut album in 1995. "Hell's Home" and "Slave Or Prayer" were made in collaboration with industrial rock producer Lee Popa. _Aiding & Abetting_ praised the band for their aggressive sound, saying the band "has put together a wild ride that massages both the club folks and metal freaks."[2] Music videos were filmed for the songs "Come Alive" and "Hell's Home". The trio disbanded shortly after the release of the album, with D. York and Sid forming the dark ambient project Liquid Sex Decay in 1997.[3]
