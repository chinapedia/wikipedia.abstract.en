_THE LION KING_ is a 2019 American computer-animated musical film directed and produced by Jon Favreau, written by Jeff Nathanson, and produced by Walt Disney Pictures. It is a photorealistic remake of Disney's traditionally animated 1994 film of the same name. The film stars the voices of Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Alfre Woodard, Billy Eichner, John Kani, John Oliver and Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, as well as James Earl Jones reprising his role from the original film. The plot follows Simba, a young lion who must embrace his role as the rightful king of his native land following the murder of his father, Mufasa, at the hands of his uncle, Scar.

Plans for a remake of _The Lion King_ were confirmed in September 2016 following the success of Disney's _The Jungle Book_, also directed by Favreau. Much of the main cast signed in early 2017 and principal production began in mid-2017 on a blue screen stage in Los Angeles.

The film was theatrically released in the United States on July 19, 2019, and has grossed $564 million worldwide, becoming the seventh highest-grossing film of 2019. It received mixed reviews, with praise for its visual effects, musical score and vocal performances, but criticism for the lack of originality and facial emotion on the characters.


Plot

In the Pride Lands of Africa, a pride of lions rule over the animal kingdom from Pride Rock. King Mufasa's and Queen Sarabi's newborn son, Simba, is presented to the gathering animals by Rafiki the mandrill, the kingdom's shaman and advisor. Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the "circle of life", which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne and plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba, so he may become king. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala (to whom Simba is betrothed) into exploring a forbidden elephants' graveyard, where they are attacked by spotted hyenas led by Shenzi, Kamari, and Azizi. Mufasa is alerted about the incident by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though upset with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. Meanwhile, Scar visits the hyenas and manages to convince them to help him overthrow Mufusa in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands.

Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing that the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead sending him falling to his death. He then convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to leave the kingdom and never return. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing his three hyena minions and the rest of their large pack to live in the Pride Lands.

Simba collapses in a desert and is rescued by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog, who are fellow outcasts. Simba grows up in the jungle with his two new friends and the other animals, living a carefree life under the motto "hakuna matata" ("no worries" in Swahili). Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that the Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He then encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing that he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.

Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who had just struck Sarabi. Scar taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba reveals the truth to the rest of the pride. Scar attempts to defend himself, but his knowledge of Mufasa's last moment (despite having previously claimed that he arrived too late at the gorge) exposes his role in Mufasa's death. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life, but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar refuses and attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterwards, Simba takes over the kingship and makes Nala his queen.

Later, with Pride Rock restored to its usual state, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.


Voice cast

-   Donald Glover as Simba:
    A lion who is the crown prince of the Pride Lands. Glover said that the film will focus more on Simba's time growing up than the original film did, stating that "[Favreau] was very keen in making sure we saw [Simba's] transition from boy to man and how hard that can be when there's been a deep trauma".[1]
    -   JD McCrary as young Simba.
-   Seth Rogen as Pumbaa:
    A slow-witted common warthog who befriends and adopts a young Simba after he runs away from home. Rogen said, "[a]s an actor, I [...] don't think I'm right for every role — there are a lot of roles I don't think I'm right for even in movies I'm making — but Pumbaa was one I knew I could do well".[2]
-   Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar:
    The treacherous brother of Mufasa and the uncle of Simba who seeks to take the mantle of king of the Pride Lands. Ejiofor described Scar as more "psychologically possessed" and "brutalized" than in the original film.[3] Ejiofor said that "especially with Scar, whether it's a vocal quality that allows for a certain confidence or a certain aggression, to always know that at the end of it you're playing somebody who has the capacity to turn everything on its head in a split second with outrageous acts of violence – that can completely change the temperature of a scene".[4] Ejiofor also said that "[Scar and Mufasa's] relationship is completely destroyed and brutalized by Scar's way of thinking. He's possessed with this disease of his own ego and his own want".[5] Favreau said of casting Ejiofor, "[He] is just a fantastic actor, who brings us a bit of the mid-Atlantic cadence and a new take on the character. He brings that feeling of a Shakespearean villain to bear because of his background as an actor. It's wonderful when you have somebody as experienced and seasoned as Chiwetel; he just breathes such wonderful life into this character."[6]
-   Alfre Woodard as Sarabi:
    The Queen of the Pride Lands, Mufasa's mate, and Simba's mother.
-   Billy Eichner as Timon:
    A wise-cracking meerkat who befriends and adopts a young Simba after he runs away from home.
-   John Kani as Rafiki:
    A wise mandrill who serves as the shaman of the Pride Lands, and a close friend of Mufasa's.[7] Likening his role to that of a grandfather, Kani said, "Rafiki reminds all of us of that special wise relative. His wisdom, humor and his loyalty to the Mufasa dynasty is what warms our hearts towards him. [He's] always happy and wisecracking jokes as lessons of life and survival."[8]
-   John Oliver as Zazu:
    A yellow-billed hornbill who is the majordomo to the King of the Pride Lands. Speaking of his role, Oliver said, "I think Zazu is basically a bird who likes structure. He just wants things to be as they should be. I think there are British echoes there because we tend to favor structure in lieu of having an emotional reaction to anything."[9]
-   Beyoncé Knowles-Carter as Nala:
    Simba's childhood best friend and future love interest. According to Favreau, the character has a bigger role than in the original film.[10] Favreau felt that "part of [Beyoncé joining the film] is that she's got young kids, part of it is that it's a story that feels good for this phase of her life and her career, and she really likes the original very much. And then, of course, there are these wonderful musical numbers that she can be involved with, and my God... she really lives up to her reputation as far as the beauty of her voice and talent".[11][12]
    -   Shahadi Wright Joseph as young Nala. Joseph reprises her role from the Broadway production.[13] Joseph chose to work on the film because "Nala inspires little girls [...] She's a great role model".[14]
-   James Earl Jones as Mufasa:
    The King of the Pride Lands and the father of Simba. Jones reprises his role from the original 1994 animated film. According to Favreau, Jones' lines remain mostly the same from the original film.[15] Ejiofor said that "the comfort of [Jones reprising his role] is going to be very rewarding in taking [the audience] on this journey again. It's a once-in-a-generation vocal quality".[16][17] Favreau saw Jones' return as "carrying the legacy across" the original film and the remake, and felt that his voice's change in tonality compared to the original film "served the role well because he sounds like a king who's ruled for a long time".[18]

Florence Kasumba, Keegan-Michael Key, and Eric Andre voice Shenzi, Kamari, and Azizi, three spotted hyenas who are Scar's henchmen. While Shenzi is a character that was featured in the original 1994 animated film, Kamari and Azizi are the respective renames of Banzai and Ed from the original film. The hyenas' characterizations were heavily altered from the original film's, as Favreau felt that they "had to change a lot" to fit the remake's realistic style, stating that "[a] lot of the stuff around them [in the original film] was very stylised".[19] Kasumba elaborated, declaring that "Those hyenas were funny. These hyenas are dangerous."[20]

Additionally, Penny Johnson Jerald voices Sarafina, Nala's mother.[21] Amy Sedaris, Chance Bennett and Josh McCrary voice a guinea fowl, a bush baby, and an elephant shrew, respectively, Timon and Pumbaa's neighbors in the jungle.[22][23] Phil LaMarr voices an impala, while J. Lee voices a hyena.[24]


Production

Development

On September 28, 2016, Walt Disney Pictures confirmed that Jon Favreau would be directing a remake of the 1994 animated film _The Lion King_, which would feature the songs from the 1994 film, following a string of recent box office successes on the other Disney live-action remake films such as _Maleficent_, _Cinderella_, Favreau's _The Jungle Book_ and _Beauty and the Beast_, with the latter three also earning critical praise.[25] On October 13, 2016, it was reported that Disney had hired Jeff Nathanson to write the screenplay for the remake,[26] with the story written by Brenda Chapman, who was the original film's head of story.[27]

In November, talking with ComingSoon.net, Favreau said the virtual cinematography technology he used in _The Jungle Book_ would be used to a greater degree in _The Lion King_.[28] Although the media reported _The Lion King_ to be a live-action film, it actually utilizes photorealistic computer-generated animation. Disney also did not describe it as live-action, only stating it would follow the "technologically groundbreaking" approach of _The Jungle Book_.[29] While the film acts as a remake of the 1994 animated film, Favreau was inspired by the Broadway adaptation of the film for certains aspects of the remake's plot, particularly Nala and Sarabi's roles.[30] Favreau also aimed to develop his own take on the original film's story with what he said was "the spectacle of a BBC wildlife documentary".[31]

This serves as the final credit for film editor Mark Livolsi, who died in September 2018.[32] The film is dedicated to him.[33]

Casting

In mid-February 2017, Donald Glover was cast as Simba, with James Earl Jones reprising his role as Mufasa from the 1994 film.[34] In April 2017, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen were cast to play Timon and Pumbaa respectively.[35] In July 2017, John Oliver was cast as Zazu.[36] In August 2017, Alfre Woodard and John Kani were announced to play Sarabi and Rafiki, respectively.[37][38]

Earlier in March 2017, it was announced that Beyoncé was Favreau's top choice for the role of Nala and that the director and studio would be willing to do whatever it took to accommodate her busy schedule.[39] Later on November 1, 2017, her role was confirmed in an official announcement,[40][41] which also confirmed that Chiwetel Ejiofor would play the role of Scar, and announced that Eric Andre, Florence Kasumba, and Keegan-Michael Key will be the voices of Azizi, Shenzi and Kamari while JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright Joseph will be the voices of young Simba and young Nala, respectively.[42][43][44][45][46] In November 2018, Amy Sedaris was announced as having been cast in a role created for the film.[47]

Visual effects

The Moving Picture Company, the lead vendor on _The Jungle Book_, provided the visual effects, which were supervised by Robert Legato, Elliot Newman and Adam Valdez.[48] The film utilizes "virtual-reality tools", per Visual Effects Supervisor Rob Legato.[49] Virtual Production Supervisor Girish Balakrishnan said on his professional website that the filmmakers used motion capture and VR/AR technologies,[50] with the production team combining VR technology with cameras in order to film the remake in a VR-simulated environment.[51] Sean Bailey, Disney's President of Production, called the film's visual effects "a new form of filmmaking", and felt that "Historical definitions don't work", stating that "[it] uses some techniques that would traditionally be called animation, and other techniques that would traditionally be called live-action. It is an evolution of the technology Jon [Favreau] used in _Jungle Book_".[52]


Music

Hans Zimmer, who composed the 1994 animated version, would return to compose the score for the remake.[53] Elton John also returned to rework his musical compositions from the original film before his retirement,[54] with Beyoncé assisting John in the reworking of the soundtrack.[55] John, the original film's lyricist, Tim Rice, and Beyoncé were also slated in 2018 to create a new song for the film.[56] However, the collaboration between Beyoncé and John did not pan out as the unreleased song was not added to the official soundtrack.[57] John and Rice also wrote a new song for the film's end credits, titled "Never Too Late" and performed by John.[58]

"Spirit", performed by Beyoncé and written by herself, Ilya Salmanzadeh, and Labrinth, was released on July 9, 2019, as the lead single from the soundtrack.[59] The film also features all the songs from the original film, a cover of The Tokens' "The Lion Sleeps Tonight", and the song "He Lives in You" from _Rhythm of the Pride Lands_ and the Broadway production.[60] The soundtrack, featuring Zimmer's score and John and Rice's songs, was released digitally on July 11, 2019, and physically on July 19, 2019.[61]

Beyoncé also produced and curated an album titled _The Lion King: The Gift_, which features "Spirit", as well as songs inspired by the film. The album was released on July 19, 2019.[62]


Marketing

The first teaser trailer and the official teaser poster for _The Lion King_ debuted during the annual Dallas Cowboys' Thanksgiving Day game on November 22, 2018.[63][64] The trailer was viewed 224.6 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the then 2nd most viewed trailer in that time period.[65] A special sneak peek featuring John Kani's voice as Rafiki and a new poster were released during the 91st Academy Awards on February 24, 2019.[66] On April 10, 2019, Disney released the official trailer featuring new footage which revealed Scar, Zazu, Simba and Nala (both as cubs and as adults), Sarabi, Rafiki, Timon and Pumbaa and the hyenas.[67] The trailer was viewed 174 million times in its first 24 hours, which was revealed on Disney's Investor Day 2019 Webcast.[68] On May 30, 2019, 11 individual character posters were released.[69] A special sneak peek featuring Beyoncé, Billy Eichner, and Seth Rogen's voices as Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa respectively, was released on June 3, 2019.[70] A special sneak peek featuring Beyoncé and Donald Glover's voices as Simba and Nala singing "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" and also featuring James Earl Jones' voice as Mufasa, was released on June 20, 2019.[71] On July 2, 2019 Disney released an extensive behind-the-scenes featurette detailing the various aspects of the film's production along with seven publicity stills featuring the voice actors facing their animal counterparts.[72]

Shot-for-shot claim

The trailers of the film led to a claim of its being a shot-for-shot remake of Disney's 1994 film. On December 23, 2018, Sean Bailey, Disney's President of Production, said that while the film will "revere and love those parts that the audience wants", there will be "things in the movie that are going to be new".[73] On April 18, 2019, Favreau stated that "some shots in the 1994 animated film are so iconic" he couldn't possibly change them, but "despite what the trailers suggest, this film is not just the same movie over again",[74] and later said "it's much longer than the original film. And part of what we're doing here is to (give it more dimension) not just visually but both story wise and emotionally."[75] On May 30, 2019, Favreau said that some of the humor and characterizations are being altered to be more consistent with the rest of the film,[76] and this remake is making some changes in certain scenes from the original film, as well as in its structure.[77] On June 14, 2019, Favreau said that, while the original film's main plot points will remain unchanged in the remake, the film will largely diverge from the original version, and hinted that the Elephant Graveyard, the hyenas' lair in the original film, will be replaced by a new location.[78] The film is approximately 30 minutes longer than the original.[79]


Release

_The Lion King_ premiered in Hollywood on July 9, 2019.[80] The film was theatrically released in the United States on July 19, 2019.[81] It will be one of the first theatrical films to be released on Disney+, alongside _Aladdin_, _Toy Story 4_, _Frozen 2_, _Captain Marvel_, and _Avengers: Endgame_.[82] The film began its international rollout a week before its domestic release, starting with July 12 in China.[83]


Reception

Box office

, _The Lion King_ has grossed $212.8million in the United States and Canada, and $351.8million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $564.7million.[84] The film had a global debut of $438.8 million, the ninth-largest of all-time.[85]

Beginning on June 24, 2019 (which marked the 25th anniversary of the release of the original film), in its first 24 hours of pre-sales, _The Lion King_ became the second-best pre-seller of 2019 on Fandango in that frame (behind _Avengers: Endgame_), while Atom Tickets reported it was their best-ever first-day sales for a family film.[86] Three weeks prior to its release, industry tracking projected the film would gross $150–170 million in its domestic opening weekend.[87][88] By the week of its release, estimates had the film debuting to as much as $180 million from 4,725 theaters, beating _Avengers: Endgame_{{'}}s record of 4,662.[89] The film made $77.9 million on its first day, including $23 million from Thursday night previews.[90] It went on to debut to $191.8 million over the weekend, the highest opening total of the Disney reimaginings of animated films (beating _Beauty and the Beast_{{'}}s $174.8 million), a July release (_Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2_{{'}}s $169.2 million) and Favreau's career (_Iron Man 2_{{'}}s $128.1 million).[91][92][93]

The film was expected to gross around $450 million over its first 10 days of global release, including $160–170 million from its worldwide opening weekend.[94] In China, where it released a week prior to the rest of the world, the film was projected to debut to $50–60 million.[95] It ended up opening to $54.2 million, besting the debuts of _The Jungle Book_ and _Beauty and the Beast_.[96] Over its first 10 days of global release the film made a total of $536.8 million, including $351.8 million from overseas territories.

Critical response

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 52% based on 326 reviews, and an average rating of 6.03/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "While it can take pride in its visual achievements, _The Lion King_ is a by-the-numbers retelling that lacks the energy and heart that made the original so beloved – though for some fans that may just be enough."[98] Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[99] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an average four out of five stars.[100]

Kenneth Turan at the _Los Angeles Times_ called the film "polished, satisfying entertainment."[101] Todd McCarthy at _The Hollywood Reporter_ considered it to be inferior to the original, noting, "The film's aesthetic caution and predictability begin to wear down on the entire enterprise in the second half."[102] At _The Guardian_, Peter Bradshaw found the film "watchable and enjoyable. But I missed the simplicity and vividness of the original hand-drawn images."[103]

A. A. Dowd, writing for _The A.V. Club_, summarized the film as "Joyless, artless, and maybe soulless, it transforms one of the most striking titles from the Mouse House vault into a very expensive, star-studded Disneynature film." Dowd bemoaned the film's insistence on realism, commenting, "We're watching a hollow bastardization of a blockbuster, at once completely reliant on the audience's pre-established affection for its predecessor and strangely determined to jettison much of what made it special."[104] Scott Mendelson at _Forbes_ condemned the film as a "crushing disappointment": "At almost every turn, this redo undercuts its own melodrama by downplaying its own emotions."[105] David Ehrlich of _IndieWire_ panned the film, writing, "Unfolding like the world's longest and least convincing deepfake, Jon Favreau's (almost) photorealistic remake of _The Lion King_ is meant to represent the next step in Disney's circle of life. Instead, this soulless chimera of a film comes off as little more than a glorified tech demo from a greedy conglomerate — a well-rendered but creatively bankrupt self-portrait of a movie studio eating its own tail."[106] Among the vocal performances, the roles of Eichner and Rogen as Timon and Pumbaa, respectively, received particular praise by critics,[107][108][109][110] with _A.V. Club_{{'}}s Dowd proclaiming: "Ultimately, only Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, as slacker sidekicks Timon and Pumbaa, make much of an impression; their funny, possibly ad-libbed banter feels both fresh and true to the spirit of the characters—the perfect remake recipe."[111]
