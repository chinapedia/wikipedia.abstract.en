Command reception

Khawaja_Muhammad_Asif_and_Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi_in_Islamabad,_Pakistan_-_2017_(37852998846).jpg and members of the federal cabinet]] In 2016, Prime Minister Sharif confirmed the timely retirement of Chairman joint chiefs General Rashad Mahmood, while General Raheel Sharif dismissed rumours of seeking the extension for his term.[62]

Initially, the race for the appointment for the army chief was rumored between Lt-Gen. Zubair Hayat and Lt-Gen. Javed Ramday who was close to the first family.[63][64] However, Prime Minister Sharif announced to appoint the senior most army general, Lt-Gen. Zubair Hayat was appointed Chairman joint chiefs committee.[65]

On 28 November 2016, Prime Minister Sharif eventually announced to appoint the fourth by seniority, General Bajwa, as the chief of army staff, superseding two generals who were senior than him.[66][67][68][69][70]

His strong pro-democracy stance and views may have influenced his appointment as an army chief as noted by the media pundits.[71] The _Reuters Pakistan_ reported that Prime Minister Sharif picked Bajwa because of his low-key style.[72] He was also noted as the fourth oldest army chief of staff.[73]

About the reception of this appointment, Gen. Bajwa is known to have a sound understanding of Indian strategic ambitions in the region and experience of armed conflict on LoC in Kashmir.[74] In December 2016, he was awarded Nishan-e-Imtiaz.[75]

Under the command of Gen. Bajwa, the nationwide counterterrorism operations and _Khyber-4_ were launched in February 2017 and July 2017, respectively.[76]

Political ambitions and far-right support

In 2017, Gen. Bajwa received significant political criticism by the political circles and the Islamabad High Court for his political role during the far-right protests. Gen. Bajwa acted to become a mediator and proposed Prime Minister to negotiate with the protesters which led to resignation of the Justice minister Zahid Hamid.[77][78][79][80]

Over the issue of supreme court case that disqualified Prime Minister Sharif, Gen. Bajwa reportedly strongly denied claims that the military had played any role in shaping the judgments.[81]

In 2017, Gen. Bajwa testified the military's support for the parliamentary system before the Senate, denying any claims made in the news media of military seeking to support the presidentialism.[82]

Allegations of political interference:The Bajwa Doctrine

In the first few months of 2018, the televised news media widely reports described his leadership vision as "_The Bajwa Doctrine_" (TBD), under that doctrine, the eighteenth amendment to the nation's constitution, the freedom of the press and the economic policies of Ishaq Dar (who was the minister of finance in the Sharif administration) were opposed in favor of the fiscal policies Gillani administration in 2012.[83]

The ISPR vehemently rejected that _The Bajwa Doctrine_ has anything to do with the economic politics and if any such doctrine exists, it is only related to the security of Pakistan.[84][85]

In Pakistan, the media reports and pundits reportedly said that _The Bajwa Doctrine_ is at play behind the blackout of Geo TV which started on 1 April 2018, started after an off the record meeting with journalists in which Gen. Bajwa threatened the management of the Geo TV with consequences if it did not toe the line of military. The term _The Bajwa Doctrine_ was coined by journalists in the result of that same off the record meeting.[86]
