The front of the Maligawa is attached to a corridor and the roof of it has been supported on carved timber columns with lotus bracket-capitals.[4] The carvings and murals those adorn the devalaya depict typical Kandyan tradition, which evidence that this shrine was constructed during the Kandyan era.
