Controversy

Perelló had a weekly radio show on Radio UNAM, called "_Sentido contrario_"[10] (roughly translated as "The Wrong Direction"), that was cancelled after he made derisive comments in reference to the case of "The Porkys of Veracruz," a group of four men belonging to upper-class families who had allegedly gang raped a woman in Boca del Río, Veracruz in January 2015. Perelló made several derisive declarations including that the victim overreacted, that penetrating a woman against her will with "broomsticks, fingers or vibrators" is under current law not considered rape, but molestation or sexual abuse, and that some women could only achieve climax during rape.[11][12]
