A peninsula ( from _paene_ "almost" and _insula_ "island") is a piece of land that is bordered by water on three sides but connected to mainland.[1][2][3][4] The surrounding water is usually understood to be continuous, though not necessarily named as such. A peninsula can also be a headland, cape, island promontory, bill, point, or spit.[5] A point is generally considered a tapering piece of land projecting into a body of water that is less prominent than a cape.[6] In English, the plural of peninsula is _peninsulas_ or, less commonly, _peninsulae_. A river which courses through a very tight meander is also sometimes said to form a "peninsula" within the (almost closed) loop of water.

Presented below is a LIST OF PENINSULAS.
