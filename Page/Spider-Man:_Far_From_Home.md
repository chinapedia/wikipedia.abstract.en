_SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME_ is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the sequel to _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ (2017) and the twenty-third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Jon Watts, written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, and stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Zendaya, Cobie Smulders, Jon Favreau, J. B. Smoove, Jacob Batalon, Martin Starr, Marisa Tomei, and Jake Gyllenhaal. In _Spider-Man: Far From Home_, Parker is recruited by Nick Fury and Mysterio to face the Elementals while he is on a school trip to Europe.

By October 2016, discussions had begun for a sequel to _Spider-Man: Homecoming_, with a release date given to the film before the end of the year. Holland was confirmed to return in July 2017, with Watts and the writers also confirmed to return by the end of that year. In 2018, Jackson and Gyllenhaal joined the cast as Fury and Mysterio, respectively. Holland revealed the sequel's title ahead of filming, which began in July 2018 and took place in England, the Czech Republic, Italy, and the New York metropolitan area. Production wrapped in October 2018. The film's marketing campaign attempted to avoid revealing spoilers for _Avengers: Endgame_ prior to that film's April 2019 release.

_Spider-Man: Far From Home_ premiered in Hollywood on June 26, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 2, 2019, in 3D and IMAX. The film was positively reviewed for its humor, visual effects, and performances (particularly Holland and Gyllenhaal). It has grossed $975 million worldwide, making it the most-successful Spider-Man film and the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2019. A sequel is in development.


Plot

In Ixtenco, Mexico, Nick Fury and Maria Hill investigate an unnatural storm and encounter the Earth Elemental. Quentin Beck, a super-powered man, arrives to fight the creature. In New York City, the Midtown School of Science and Technology restarts its academic year to accommodate the students who were among those resurrected in "the Blip" eight months earlier. The school organizes a two-week summer field trip to Europe, where Peter Parker, while still distraught over Tony Stark's death, plans to confess his growing feelings for classmate MJ and avoid heroics. At a fundraiser for the homeless coordinated by his Aunt May, Parker is forewarned by Happy Hogan that he will be contacted by Fury, but Parker chooses to ignore the call. Parker leaves after being overwhelmed by questions about Stark.

Parker and his friends travel to Venice, Italy. Parker's classmate Brad emerges as a competitor for MJ's affections. The Water Elemental strikes Venice and wreaks havoc on the city. Beck arrives and destroys the creature. Fury meets with Parker and gives him Stark's glasses, which were meant for his successor. The glasses are equipped with the artificial intelligence E.D.I.T.H., which has access to all databases of Stark Industries and commands a large orbital weapons supply. Beck claims the Elementals killed his family and that he hails from a different reality, one among many in the Multiverse. Parker rejects Fury's call to arms, opting to rejoin his class.

Fury covertly redirects the school trip's itinerary to Prague, where the Fire Elemental is projected to strike. It appears at a carnival, but Beck, with Parker's help, destroys it. Fury and Hill invite Parker and Beck to Berlin to discuss the formation of a new superhero team. Parker considers Beck worthy of being Stark's successor and bequeaths him the E.D.I.T.H. glasses. Unbeknownst to him, Beck is revealed to be a former holographic-illusions specialist at Stark Industries who was fired for his unstable nature. He now leads a team of disgruntled ex-Stark employees, using advanced projector drones to simulate the Elemental attacks and masquerade as a hero.

MJ deduces Parker is Spider-Man. They discover that a piece of debris she retrieved during the carnival battle is a projector that presents a simulation of the Air Elemental, leading the two to realize Beck is a fraud. Parker travels to Berlin and meets with Fury. Realizing that he is in an illusion, Parker battles multiple illusions before Fury apparently subdues Beck. Fury forces Parker to reveal anyone he told of Beck's deception before being revealed as another illusion. Ultimately hit by a train, a badly injured Parker falls unconscious in a train car.

Awakening in a jail cell in the Netherlands, Parker breaks out and contacts Hogan, who flies Parker to London and reveals a suit-manufacturing machine left behind by Stark, which Parker uses to synthesize a customized costume. In London, Beck uses E.D.I.T.H. to orchestrate his biggest illusion yet, a fusion of all four Elementals, using it as cover to kill MJ and any others to whom she might have revealed his secret. Parker disrupts the illusion, so Beck reveals the drones to attack him. Parker defeats Beck, regaining control of E.D.I.T.H. to call off the drone attacks. Beck dies from wounds sustained from misfired drone gunshots. An assistant of Beck's escapes with data of the events. Parker returns to New York City and begins a relationship with MJ.

In a mid-credits scene, reporter J. Jonah Jameson of TheDailyBugle.net broadcasts doctored footage of the London incident, in which Beck incriminates Spider-Man for the drone attack and his death, and he reveals Spider-Man's secret identity. In a post-credits scene, the Skrulls Talos and Soren are revealed to have been masquerading the whole time as Fury and Hill, respectively, as directed by the real Fury, who commands a Skrull spaceship.


Cast

-   Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:
    A teenager and Avenger who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a genetically-modified spider.[1] Director Jon Watts said that in contrast to _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ in which Parker longs for the responsibilities of an adult, in _Far From Home_, he wants to hang onto his youth, saying, "This film is about the world telling him, 'It's time for you to step up and grow up, kid,' and he's saying, 'But I still want to be a kid and go on vacation.'"[2]
-   Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury:
    The former director of S.H.I.E.L.D.[3] Watts describes Fury's relationship with Parker as "the mean new stepdad", contrasting his role with Tony Stark's "supportive cool uncle" in _Homecoming_, saying, "Fury doesn't see himself in Peter Parker. Fury sees Peter Parker as an asset that he needs who is too preoccupied with a bunch of high school problems." Watts originally pitched _Homecoming_ using Fury as a mentor to Parker.[4] _Far From Home_ puts Fury in a situation in which he does not have the same level of control he is used to having.[5]
-   Zendaya as MJ : Parker's classmate and love interest whose real name is Michelle but is mostly known as MJ.[6][7][8][9]
-   Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill: A former high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who works closely with Nick Fury.[10]
-   Jon Favreau as Harold "Happy" Hogan: The head of security for Stark Industries and former driver and bodyguard of Tony Stark who looks after Parker.[11] Watts noted Happy would be used to explore the idea of "trying to find your place in the world if the center of your world is gone" given his close friendship to Stark.[12]
-   J. B. Smoove as Julius Dell: Parker's teacher and a chaperone on his school trip to Europe. The role was written for Smoove after the writers and director enjoyed his performance alongside Holland in an Audi commercial short film produced to promote _Homecoming_.[13][14]
-   Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds: Parker's best friend.[15][16][17]
-   Martin Starr as Roger Harrington: Parker's academic decathlon teacher and a chaperone on his school trip to Europe.[18][19]
-   Marisa Tomei as May Parker: Parker's aunt who is aware of his secret identity and wants him to be Spider-Man more so he can help with charitable causes.[20][21][22]
-   Jake Gyllenhaal as Quentin Beck / Mysterio:
    A master of trickery and illusion who claims to be a superhero from Earth-833 in the Multiverse. He is recruited by Nick Fury to help Spider-Man stop the Elementals.[23][24][25] Gyllenhaal shared ideas with screenwriters Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers regarding the character's personality. Sommers said, "[Gyllenhaal] just really liked the idea that he was manipulating everyoneâ€™s love of superheroes and that need for heroes. He also wanted to make sure that the front half of his character played as realistically as possible," in reference to Mysterio's fake backstory.[26] Regarding Beck's relationship with Parker, Watts says that "If Tony Stark was sort of the mentor in the previous films, we thought it would be interesting to play Mysterio as almost like the cool uncle."[27] Having Beck team up with Fury and Parker to take on a global threat was "really exciting" to Watts, who wanted to bring the character into the MCU "in a way that people weren't expecting."[28]

Tony Revolori and Angourie Rice reprise their roles from _Homecoming_ as Eugene "Flash" Thompson, Parker's classmate and rival,[29] and Betty Brant, Parker's classmate and Ned's off-and-on girlfriend.[30][31] Hemky Madera also returned as Mr. Delmar, the owner of a local bodega, though his scenes were cut from the final film and re-purposed for a short film that will be included as part of _Far From Home_{{'s}} Blu-ray release.[32][33] Peter Billingsley appears as William Ginter Riva, reprising his role from _Iron Man_ (2008), as a scientist who formerly worked for Obadiah Stane and who now works for Beck.[34] Jeff Bridges and Robert Downey Jr. also appear as Stane and Tony Stark through the use of archival footage from _Iron Man_ and _Captain America: Civil War_ (2016), respectively.[35][36] Downey, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and Paul Bettany briefly make photographic appearances as Stark, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and the Vision, respectively, in the beginning of the film as part of an "in memoriam" segment, with images taken from previous MCU films.[37][38]

Additionally, Numan Acar portrays Fury's associate Dimitri ,[39][40] and Remy Hii plays Brad Davis, a popular student who Parker sees as competition for MJ's affection.[41][42] Zach Barack portrays Zach, one of Parker's new classmates, while Oli Hill was cast in an undisclosed role that was cut from the final film.[43][44][45] Barack's role made him the first openly transgender actor in the MCU.[46] J. K. Simmons appears as J. Jonah Jameson in the mid-credits scene, reprising the character he had played in Sam Raimi's _Spider-Man_ film trilogy;[47] it marks the first time an MCU character is portrayed by the same actor who had previously portrayed a non-MCU incarnation of the character.[48] Ben Mendelsohn and Sharon Blynn play the Skrulls Talos and Soren, respectively, reprising their roles from _Captain Marvel_ (2019) in the post-credits scene; both actors were uncredited.[49] The Elementals are modeled after the Spider-Man comic book villains Hydro-Man, Molten Man, Sandman, and Cyclone and appear in the film through visual effects as illusions created through the use of drones and projectors controlled by Mysterio.[50][51][52][53]


Production

Development

In June 2016, Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman stated that Sony and Marvel Studios were committed to making future _Spider-Man_ films after _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ (2017).[54] The following month, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said if additional films were made, the company had an early idea to follow the model of the _Harry Potter_ film series, and have the plot of each film cover a new school year,[55] with a second film intended to take place during Parker's junior year of high school.[56] By October 2016, discussions had begun for a second film, including which villain would be featured, according to Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, who was signed for three _Spider-Man_ films including _Homecoming_.[57][58] In December, after the successful release of the first _Homecoming_ trailer, Sony slated a sequel to the film for July 5, 2019.[59] Sony's insistence that the sequel be released in 2019 complicated Marvel's preference for secrecy regarding their plans for Spider-Man, since the character would die at the end of _Avengers: Infinity War_ (2018), and not be resurrected before _Avengers: Endgame_ in April 2019.[60]

Sony was revealed in June 2017 to have the use of another Marvel Studios-controlled character for the film, as it did with Iron Man for _Homecoming_.[61] Feige stated that Marvel and Sony were "just starting to solidify our plans" for the film, and felt Spider-Man's appearances in _Avengers: Infinity War_ and _Avengers: Endgame_ would "launch him off into a very new cinematic universe at that point", similar to how _Captain America: Civil War_ (2016) "informed everything in _Homecoming_".[62] Marvel and Sony were both keen on having _Homecoming_ director Jon Watts return for the sequel, with Feige saying "thatâ€™s the intention for sure" and Pascal noting they "would be crazy [not to]" have him return. Watts also noted he was signed for two films.[63] Additionally, Feige mentioned the film would be titled in a similar fashion to _Homecoming_, using a subtitle, and would not feature "2" in the title. He also stated that filming was expected to begin in April or May 2018.[64] As with _Homecoming_, Feige stated that the film's villain would be one that had not yet been seen in film.[65] By July 2017, Watts was in negotiations with the studios to return for the sequel,[66] and Marisa Tomei expressed interest in reprising her role as Aunt May from the previous film.[67]

Pascal said the film would begin "a few minutes" after the conclusion of _Avengers: Endgame_.[68] A specific amount of time is not stated in the film, but Watts felt it was "almost immediately" after _Endgame_.[69] Given this, Watts felt this posed "a fun creative challenge" for the _Far From Home_ team, allowing them to deal with many of the unanswered questions from _Endgame_. Watts added they looked to "make a movie thatâ€™s in that world and deals with those stories but is also still [a] fun Spider-Man movie". For example, Ned, MJ, and Flash all turned to dust during the events of _Infinity War_ along with Parker, while some of his classmates were not and are now five years older. Watts compared this dynamic to the film _Flight of the Navigator_ (1986), calling the situation "really weird... but... also something you can have a lot of fun with".[70]

Pre-production

At the end of August 2017, as the film was entering pre-production,[71] Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, two of the writers on _Homecoming_, were in final negotiations to return for the sequel.[72] In early October 2017, Jacob Batalon confirmed he would reprise his role of Ned in the film.[73] In December 2017, Feige confirmed that Watts was returning to direct the sequel.[74] By February 2018, Zendaya was slated to return for the film, reprising her role as Michelle / MJ.[75] By late April, filming was scheduled to begin in early July 2018, with Feige saying filming would occur in London, instead of Atlanta as with the first film. Feige explained that one of the reasons behind this was because a majority of the film would be spent around the world, outside New York City.[76]

A month later, Jake Gyllenhaal entered negotiations to play Mysterio, while Tomei and Michael Keaton were confirmed to reprise their respective roles of May and Adrian Toomes / Vulture; McKenna and Sommers were also confirmed as the film's screenwriters.[77][78] Watts would later state that Keaton and Laura Harrier would not appear in the film.[79] At the end of June 2018, Holland revealed the film's title to be _Spider-Man: Far From Home_,[80] and the casting of Gyllenhaal was confirmed.[81] Feige explained that they decided to reveal the title in this way because of the potential for the title to leak after filming began.[82] He compared the title to _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ in that it is "full of alternate meaning" while continuing the use of "Home",[83] and explained that the film focuses on Parker and his friends going to Europe on summer vacation, away from their home of New York.[84]

Filming

Spider-Man_Far_From_Home_Venice_Set.jpg, Italy]] Principal photography began on location in Hertfordshire, England on July 2, 2018,[85] under the working title _Fall of George_,[86] with Matthew J. Lloyd serving as director of photography.[87] Filming also took place in London,[88] with filming locations including East London,[89] and at London Stansted Airport.[90] Studio work occurred at Leavesden Studios near Watford, England, where a recreation of Venice was created on one of the studio's backlots.[91][92] Shortly after the start of filming, set photos revealed Hemky Madera would reprise his role as Mr. Delmar, the owner of a local bodega,[93] and J.B. Smoove and Numan Acar joined the cast.[94][95] By early August, Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders were confirmed to be appearing in the film, reprising their respective roles of Nick Fury and Maria Hill from previous MCU films,[96] and Remy Hii joined the cast later in the month.[97] Filming took place in Prague and Liberec in the Czech Republic in September,[98][99] and moved to Venice by the end of the month.[100] Filming moved to New York City and Newark, New Jersey in October, where it used the working title _Bosco_.[101][102] Locations included areas around Madison Square Garden and Penn Station,[103] and Newark Liberty International Airport.[104] Filming wrapped on October 16, 2018.[105]

Post-production

In late October 2018, Sony Pictures reached a new multi-film agreement with IMAX Corporation to release their films in IMAX, including _Far From Home_.[106] At Sony's CCXP Brazil panel in December 2018, it was revealed the Elementals would appear in the film.[107] Each of the Elementals are inspired by other Spider-Man villains, such as the water one by Hydro-Man and the fire one by Molten Man, but they are not called such.[108][109] Martin Starr was confirmed to be reprising his role as Mr. Harrington from _Homecoming_ the next month.[110][111] In April 2019, Sony moved the film's release date up to July 2, 2019.[112] Additionally, while promoting _Avengers: Endgame_ at a fan event in Shanghai, Feige said _Far From Home_ would serve as the final film of the MCU's Phase Three; it had previously been believed that _Far From Home_ would start Phase Four after _Endgame_ concluded Phase Three.[113] Also in April, Jackson returned to do reshoots for the film.[114] Post-production wrapped in June 2019.[115]

The visual effects are provided by Framestore, Industrial Light & Magic, Image Engine, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Luma Pictures, Rising Sun Pictures, Scanline VFX, Territory Studio, and Method Studios.[116]


Music

_Spider-Man: Homecoming_ composer Michael Giacchino was confirmed to return to score _Far From Home_ in October 2018.[117][118] Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" plays during the Marvel Studios opening logo as part of the film's opening scene.[119] The soundtrack album was released by Sony Classical on June 28, 2019.[120]


Marketing

Due to Parker dying at the end of _Avengers: Infinity War_ and not being resurrected until _Avengers: Endgame_,[121][122][123] Germain Lussier of io9 noted that Sony would either have to begin marketing this film only two months before its release or spoil the fact that Parker is resurrected for general audiences that may not realize that this would happen in the next _Avengers_ film. Lussier suggested that the latter approach be taken, while a representative of Sony said that the studio would be working with Marvel to "figure out the Spider-Man strategy".[124]

The first trailer for _Spider-Man: Far From Home_ was shown at Sony's CCXP Brazil panel on December 8, 2018, with Holland and Gyllenhaal in attendance to promote the film. The footage did not acknowledge the events of _Infinity War_ or _Endgame_, with Steven Weintraub of Collider describing it as a continuation of "the _Spider-Man_ universe" only.[125] The first trailer was publicly released on January 15, 2019, after Holland debuted it on his Instagram account.[126] A second, international version of the trailer was also released, which featured slight differences.[127] Alex Abad-Santos of _Vox_ felt the trailer "arrived at a curious time" given the last time Parker was seen, he had died in _Infinity War_. Abad-Santos added that the trailer was "a roundabout way" to reveal that Parker and others would be revived in _Endgame_.[128] Other news outlets also commented on Parker's appearance in the trailer given the events of _Infinity War_,[129][130] with Zack Straf of IndieWire pointing out that, while it appeared Parker does return, the audience was still left wondering how he returns.[131]

Adam Chitwood of Collider said, "This trailer looks exactly like a sequel to _Spider-Man: Homecoming_. It's cute and fun, and I love the idea of sending the kids on a European vacation. Adding Nick Fury to the mix also increases the stakes from an MCU standpoint, and I like that Jake Gyllenhaal's Mysterio is only revealed in mysterious fashion". However, he added that _Far From Home_ felt "the tiniest bit less special" when "judged so closely to [the animated film] _Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_", given the latter's success as an "animated masterwork".[132] Chitwood also spoke to the teaser poster released for the film, calling it "really fun, leaning into the whole 'summer vacation' vibe of the film as the iconic Spider-Man mask is covered in travel stickers," with the stickers potentially hinting at all the locations in the film.[133]

Graeme McMillian of _The Hollywood Reporter_ felt the trailer was crafted in a way that presented the Elementals as the threat, when in fact, they could turn out to be "massive illusions on behalf of Mysterio as part of as-yet-unknown scheme", with Mysterio the true threat. He added, "Such a deception not only allows the audience to be as thrown off the scent as the movie's hero, but it also gives _Far From Home_ the opportunity to stay as grounded as _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ was, in terms of narrative scale".[134] McMillian's colleague Richard Newby stated, "The main takeaway from the trailer is that _Spider-Man: Far From Home_ is deftly blending old and new school elements of the Spider-Man mythos, for a result that feels surprisingly fresh", and concluded, "_Spider-Man: Far From Home_ looks like a strong next step in Spider-Man's story, with enough intrigue and heart to make it a fitting first chapter of the MCU's next phase." Newby was also excited about the inclusion of Nick Fury in the film, as it would allow Spider-Man "to become established in another corner of the MCU".[135] _Forbes_{{'}} senior contributor Scott Mendelson noted "the sheer confidence on display" from Sony with the teasers since Sony was "in a place where they are on a winning streak when it comes to Spidey movies" after the successes of _Homecoming_, _Venom_, and _Into the Spider-Verse_.[136] The trailer received 130 million views in 24 hours, surpassing _Homecoming_ (116 million views) as the most viewed Sony Pictures trailer in that time period.[137]

On May 6, 2019, a second trailer for the film was released. The trailer featured an introduction from Holland warning viewers that it includes spoilers for _Avengers: Endgame_.[138] Watts, who knew the plots of _Infinity War_ and _Endgame_ and worked with the Russo brothers on Spider-Man's appearances in those films, was relieved that the trailer's release allowed him to speak more openly about _Far From Home_.[139] The second trailer was viewed 135 million times in 24 hours, surpassing the first _Far From Home_ trailer as the most viewed Sony Pictures trailer in that time period.[140] Beginning the weekend after the trailer's release, screenings of _Endgame_ began with a message from Holland telling audiences to stay till the end of the credits, with the trailer played at the end of the film. Marvel previously added a trailer for _The Avengers_ (2012) to the end of _Captain America: The First Avenger_ (2011).[141]

United Airlines served as a promotional partner on the film, with one of their Boeing 777 aircraft and several United employees appearing in the film.[142] As done with previous MCU films, Audi also sponsored the film, promoting several vehicles such as the e-tron SUV, while having some of their other vehicles appear in the film.[143] Partnering with several other companies, including Dr Pepper, Papa John's Pizza and Burger King, the film had a total promotional marketing value of $288 million, the most of any film of all-time.[144]

Three weeks before its domestic release, official industry tracking had the film grossing around $170 million over its six-day opening frame. Some had the film reaching as high as $200 million, while others were at a conservative $165 million; Sony was predicting a $154 million debut.[152][153] By the week of release industry estimates lowered to $140 million, with the studio expecting $120 million, due to the recent underperformance of other sequels like _Toy Story 4_.[154] Playing in 4,634 theaters (second all-time behind _Avengers: Endgame_), _Far From Home_ made a Tuesday-opening record $39.3 million, including an estimated $2.8â€“3 million from midnight previews at about 1,000 theaters.[155] It then made $27 million on its second day, the best-ever Wednesday gross for an MCU film, and $25.1 million on the 4th of July, the second highest ever total for the holiday behind _Transformers_ ($29 million in 2007).[156] In its opening weekend the film made $92.6 million,[157] and a total of $185.1 million over the six-day frame, topping the $180 million made by _Spider-Man 2_ over its six day 4th of July opening in 2004.[158] In its second weekend, the film made $45.3 million, again topping the box office with a 51% decrease from the first week; lower than _Homecoming_{{'}}s 62% drop in its second box office weekend.[159] _Far From Home_ grossed $21 million in its third weekend but was dethroned by newcomer _The Lion King_.[160]

_Far From Home_ was projected to gross around $350 million worldwide by the end of its first week of release, and about $500 million over its first 10 days.[161][162] In China and Japan, where it was released a week prior to its U.S. debut, the film was expected to gross around a combined $90 million in its opening weekend.[163] In China, where pre-sale tickets were less than _Homecoming_{{'}}s, the film made $35.5 million on its first day, including $3.4 million from midnight previews (the fourth-best of all time for a superhero film in the country).[164] It ended up slightly over-performing, debuting to $111 million including $98 million in China, the fourth-best-ever superhero opening in the country.[165] _Far From Home_ ended up grossing $580.1 million worldwide over its first 10 days of release, including $238 million from international territories in its opening weekend. In China, the film had a 10-day total of $167.4 million, and its other biggest debuts were South Korea ($33.8 million), the United Kingdom ($17.8 million), Mexico ($13.9 million) and Australia ($11.9 million).[166]

Critical response

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 90% approval rating based on 391 reviews, with an average rating of 7.45/10. The website's critics' consensus reads, "A breezily unpredictable blend of teen romance and superhero action, _Spider-Man: Far From Home_ stylishly sets the stage for the next era of the MCU."[167] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 69 out of 100 based on 55 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[168] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale,[169] while those at PostTrak gave it an overall positive score of 90% and a "definite recommend" of 76%.[170]

Owen Gleiberman of _Variety_ praised Holland's performance and wrote, "By the end, this Spider-Man really does find his tingle, yet coming after _Into the Spider-Verse_, with its swirling psychedelic imagery and identity games and trap doors of perception, _Spider-Man: Far From Home_ touches all the bases of a conventional Marvel movie. It doesn't take you out of this world. But it's good enough to summon the kickâ€”or maybe just the illusionâ€”of consequence."[171] Writing for the _Chicago Sun-Times_, Richard Roeper gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling it "zesty, sweet and satisfying" and praised the performances of the cast.[172] Bernard Boo of _PopMatters_ praised the film, commenting, "Spider-Man: Far From Home is technically the final film in Phase [Three] of the MCU, and it's hard to think of a better way to send off the most successful run of one of the highest grossing franchises in history."[173] Alonso Duralde of _TheWrap_ wrote, "If anything, and this is a compliment, the film frequently feels like a charming teen road-trip comedy that occasionally turns into a superhero movie. The wonderful cast certainly helps, with Holland and Batalon continuing their lovely comic rapport, augmented by Zendaya's deadpan Daria-ness and Rice giving Tracy Flick realness with a sweet center. Gyllenhaal nails his character's earnestness but also clearly enjoys a few moments that let him channel every exasperated-sigh, I-just-want-to-get-this-right male diva director he's ever known."[174]

Writing for IndieWire, David Ehrlich gave the film a grade of "C" and, despite complimenting the cast, called the film an "unadventurous bit of superhero housekeeping that only exists to clean up the mess that _Avengers: Endgame_ left behind" and said, "But the Spider-Man we find at the end of the movie is no different than the one we met at the start; he's more confident now, and ready to accept a truth of his own design, but you can't help but feel like he could have learned all of the same things without leaving Queens or wasting our time."[175]


Future

In April 2017, it was announced that a potential third film is planned.[176] Also in April, Holland announced that the film would take place during Parker's senior year of high school.[177] In July 2019, Kevin Feige stated that the third film would feature "a Peter Parker story that has never been done before on film" based on this film's post-credits scenes.[178]
