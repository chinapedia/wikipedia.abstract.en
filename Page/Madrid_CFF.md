MADRID CLUB DE FÚTBOL FEMENINO (; _Madrid Women's Football Club_) is a Spanish women's football club based in San Sebastián de los Reyes, Community of Madrid, that currently plays in Primera División.


History

Madrid CFF was founded in 2010 by Alfredo Ulloa who chose to play in white kits in homage to Real Madrid, although the club has no connection to Real, who are not involved in women's football.[1] Media speculation that the club would be taken over by Real Madrid in 2014 proved to be unfounded.[2]

In 2013, after playing three seasons in the regional leagues, the club made its debut in Segunda División. Four years later, the club promoted for the first time ever to the first division. After this promotion, the club moved to Estadio Matapiñonera in San Sebastián de los Reyes.
