WILLIAM "WILLY" MURPHY[1] (1936–1976) was an American underground cartoonist and editor. Murphy's humor focused on hippies and the counterculture. His signature character was Arnold Peck the Human Wreck, "a mid-30s beanpole with wry observations about his own life and the community around him."[2] Murphy's solo title was called _Flamed-Out Funnies_; in addition, he contributed to such seminal underground anthologies as _Arcade_, _Bijou Funnies_, and _San Francisco Comic Book_, as well as the _National Lampoon_.

Murphy's work was of the "bigfoot" style of cartooning, with characters having long, droopy noses; and was characterized by strong, humorous writing.[3]


Biography

Murphy was born in New York City in 1936.[4] Before becoming a cartoonist, he worked for eight years as an advertising copywriter at J. Walter Thompson[5] in New York City.[6] The upheaval of the late 1960s, including experimenting with drug use and opposition to the Vietnam War, led Murphy to leave that world behind and dedicate himself to social commentary though his cartooning.[7] In 1969, Murphy contributed to the all-comics tabloid _Gothic Blimp Works_. Moving to San Francisco around 1970, he was a key contributor to _San Francisco Comic Book_, and illustrated the cover of the fourth issue.

Some time in the early 1970s, along with Larry Todd and Gary King, Murphy began hanging around the Air Pirates collective — Dan O'Neill, Shary Flenniken, Bobby London, Gary Hallgren, and Ted Richards — and contributing to their projects.

In early 1972, Murphy edited the comics section of _Sunday Paper_, the ambitious but brief-lived broadsheet section of underground comics published by John Bryan.

Murphy illustrated the convention program of Berkeleycon 73, the first comic convention that really highlighted underground comix.[8]

In 1973–1974, Murphy helped co-found the self-publishing venture Cartoonists Co-Op Press, with Jay Lynch, Kim Deitch, Bill Griffith, Jerry Lane, Diane Noomin, and Art Spiegelman.

Murphy illustrated a number of stories by Harvey Pekar, some of which were published in Murphy's own _Flamed-Out Funnies_ #1 (Rip Off Press, 1975) and later appeared in Pekar's _American Splendor_.

In 1976, Murphy and Gary Hallgren worked closely with Gilbert Shelton and Ted Richards on _Give Me Liberty: a Revised History of the American Revolution_, Rip Off Press' comic about the hoopla surrounding the American Bicentennial.[9]

Death and testimonials

After developing a cold, Murphy died suddenly of pneumonia over the Washington's Birthday weekend in 1976.[10] Ted Richards wrote a eulogy for Murphy which was published in _Arcade_ #6 (Summer 1976).[11] That issue also featured a portfolio of Murphy's work. Murphy's work was also posthumously published in _San Francisco Comic Book_ issue #5 and #7, published in 1980 and 1983 respectively.


Legacy

Murphy's work inspired later cartoonists like Gilbert Shelton, Paul Mavrides,[12] and Wayno.[13]
