This is a TIMELINE OF OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION.


Overview

  Time period   Summary
  ------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1870–1931     Earliest ideas of optical character recognition (OCR) are conceived. Fournier d'Albe's Optophone and Tauschek's Reading Machine are developed as devices to help the blind read.[1]
  1931–1954     First OCR tools are invented and applied in industry, able to interpret Morse code and read text out loud. The Intelligent Machines Research Corporation is the first company created to sell such tools.[2]
  1954–1974     The Optacon, the first portable OCR device, is developed. Similar devices are used to digitise Reader's Digest coupons and postal addresses. Special typefaces are designed to facilitate scanning.[3][4][5]
  1974–2000     Scanners are used massively to read price tags and passports.[6] Companies such as Caere Corporation, ABBYY and Kurzweil Computer Products Inc, are created. The latter one develops the first omni-font OCR software, capable of reading any text document.[7]
  2000–2016     OCR software is made available online for free, through products like Adobe Acrobat, WebOCR, and Google Drive.[8][9]
