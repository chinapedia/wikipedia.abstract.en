_CORYMBIA SETOSA_, commonly known as the ROUGH LEAVED BLOODWOOD[1] and the ROUGH LEAVED RANGE GUM,[2] is a member of the genus _Corymbia_ native to northern Australia.[3]


Description

The straggly tree typically grows to a height of or rarely as a thick trunked mallee. It forms a lignotuber and has a single trunk and a sparse canopy.[4] The brown to yellow brown bark is deeply tessellated and persists to the small branches.[5] Adult leaves opposite, dull, grey-green, thin, concolorous with a broad lanceolate to ovate or suborbiculate shape. They are acute to obtuse to rounded with a length of long and a width of . When the tree blooms in June it produces a terminal or axillary simple conflorescence with regular 3-flowered to 7-flowered umbellasters. The flowers are cream or yellow in colour. It will produce fruit in April or September that are ovoid and pedicellate with a length of and a diameter of .[6]


Distribution

The species is found in Queensland[7] and the Northern Territory.[8] It grows on rocky hills and red sandy plains, not extending to wet tropical areas.[9] The tree is found in the Tennant Creek, Northern Territory, Daly Waters and the Barkly Tableland of the Northern Territory east into the Gulf of Carpentaria hinterland and islands, to the Musgrave area of Cape York Peninsula and south as far as Barcaldine in Queensland.[10]

In a woodland setting associated species include _Erythrophleum chlorostachys_, _Eucalyptus foelscheana_, _Xanthostemon paradoxus_, _Eucalyptus confertiflora_ and _Eucalyptus latifolia_ in the overstorey and _Grevillea decurrens_, _Gardenia megasperma_ and _Calytrix exstipulata_ in the sparsely vegetated understorey.[11]


History

_C. setosa_ was first described by the botanist Johannes Conrad Schauer in Walpers' journal, _Repertorium Botanices Systematicae 2, suppl. 1 926_, in 1843 as EUCALYPTUS SETOSA. The description came from samples collected by R. Brown & Ferd. Bauer from Allen Island in Queensland in 1802.[12] Botanists Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson were the first to define the genus _Corymbia_ in 1995, identifying the bloodwoods, ghost gums and spotted gums as a group distinct from _Eucalyptus_.[13]

There are two subspecies:

-   _Corymbia setosa_ subsp. _indeterminate_[14]
-   _Corymbia setosa_ subsp. _pedicellaris_[15]
