BORJ ECH CHEMALI () is a village in the Tyre District in South Lebanon, located just east of Tyre.


Name

According to E. H. Palmer in 1881, the name _Burj esh Shem√¢ly_ means "the northern tower".[1]


History

In 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's _Survey of Western Palestine_ (SWP) described it as: "A large village built of stone, containing about 300 Metawileh, placed on a low ridge, with figs, olives, and arable land around. There are two good springs near.[2]

They further noted that it was "a village with a similar tower of drafted masonry (as that of Borj Rahal). The hill is crowned by a stronghold, the vaults of which, slightly ogival, do not appear older than the Crusaders, but it was constructed of older blocks, some in drafted masonry and others completely smoothed. About a mile to the south-west of this hill is a subterranean series of tombs, each containing several ranges of loculi, which was explored by Renan."[3]
