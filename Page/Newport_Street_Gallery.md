Newport_Street_Gallery,_London.jpg The NEWPORT STREET GALLERY is an art gallery in London, England which displays works selected from the personal art collection of Damien Hirst. It is located on Newport Street Vauxhall. Newport Street Gallery is the realisation of Hirst’s long-term ambition to share his art collection with the public.

Hirst announced plans for the gallery in March 2012,[1] and it opened in October 2015.[2] It includes a cafe, gallery shop and offices for Hirst's company.[3]

The building is a former theatre carpentry and scenery production workshop, redesigned by Caruso St John. The design was praised for its "virtuosity", and in October 2016 it won the RIBA Stirling Prize.[4]

The gallery spans 37,000 square feet and includes six exhibition spaces – one with a ceiling height of 11 metres – split over two levels.


The collection

The Murderme collection, which Hirst has been acquiring since the late 1980s, contains over 3,000 works and features works by Francis Bacon, Banksy, Tracey Emin, Richard Hamilton, Jeff Koons, Sarah Lucas, Pablo Picasso, Richard Prince, Haim Steinbach and Gavin Turk, as well as a number of young and emerging artists and a significant collection of ork by indigenous artists from the Pacific Northwest Coast. Also featured are natural history specimens, taxidermy, anatomical models and historical artefacts. The collection has previously been the subject of large-scale exhibitions at the Serpentine Gallery, London (2006) and the Pinacoteca Agnelli, Turin (2013).
