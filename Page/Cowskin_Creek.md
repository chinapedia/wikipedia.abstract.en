COWSKIN CREEK is a stream in northwest Douglas and extreme southeastern Webster counties of Missouri.[1] Cowskin has its headwaters in southeast Webster County west of Cedar Gap and is a tributary to Beaver Creek which it joins just west of the Arno store. The stream is bridged by Missouri Route 14 just east of the junction with Missouri Route K.[2]

According to tradition, a pioneer citizen skinned cows who had died of disease near this creek.[3]
