Personal life

Marjolaine (Margo) Grant Walsh was born in 1936 to Alfred and Ann Grant, on Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Fort Peck, Montana. Her father was a Chippewa, her mother or Scottish origin.[3] Shortly after her birth, the Grants moved to the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation in Belcourt, North Dakota,[4] a Chippewa Indian reservation near the Canadian border where Grant spent her childhood. After the start of World War Two, the Grant family moved to the Portland, Oregon area, to assist in the war effort at the Kaiser Shipyards. Grant resided in Portland until beginning her college career at the University of Oregon, in Eugene, OR. On 20 February 1994, Margo Grant married John Perry Walsh, becoming Margo Grant Walsh, at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, NY.[5][6] Mr. Walsh – a class of 1950 Yale graduate with an MBA from New York University – was a private investor and former president of Florence Walsh Fashions Inc., his late mothers company. Mr. Walsh lost his battle with cancer on 5 September 1998.[7]


Education

After high school, Grant took courses at the Portland Art Museum, which she later credited as sparking her interest in making a career in interior design.[8] She graduated from the University of Oregon Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Science in 1959 and a Bachelor of Interior Architecture in 1960.[9]


Professional career

Skidmore, Owings and Merrill

Post-graduation, Walsh spent thirteen years at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in San Francisco, climbing though the ranks and garnering the title of associate/director of interior design. Initially the firm's partners were hesitant to go after interiors projects, and only sought to do projects in buildings also designed by the firm. Walsh Grant eventually convinced them to aggressively market their interiors studio.[10]

Gensler and Associates

In 1973 Walsh took a position at Gensler and Associates. When she first spoke with Art Gensler, the firm, which eventually became the largest interiors firm in the world, only had three employees. She became Director of Interior Design in their Houston office with a staff of 35–in 1979 she opened Gensler's New York City offices – where she was promoted to founder and managing principal of the eastern region division. Later, she opened offices in Washington D.C. and Boston, before taking Gensler global to London in 1988. Before leaving Gensler in 2004, Ms. Walsh became one of four on the board of directors, and left the company with a staff of nearly 2,000.[11]
