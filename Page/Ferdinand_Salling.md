FERDINAND CHRISTIAN SALLING (10 May 1880 – 22 June 1953) was a Danish merchant and entrepreneur who founded one of the largest warehouse chains and companies in Denmark. Ferdinand Salling founded the Salling warehouse chain and the company that would later own most of Dansk Supermarked. Hans Christian Salling married Karen Marie Jensen (1838–1919) on 30 July 1918 and the couple had the son Herman Salling.[1][2]

Ferdinand Salling's parents were Hans Christian Salling (1841–1923) and Karen Marie Jensen (1838–1919). After completing school Ferdinand was given an apprenticeship at _Ulrich Marcussen_ Fredericia. Salling later moved on to work for _P. Sieburg_ Odense and Alfred Zacho in Randers. In Randers Ferdinand had to manage the store for some time during the illness of his boss. His time in Randers may have given him the experience and confidence his own business. On 19 October 1906 he opened the store "Ferdinand Salling" in Aarhus. Initially he sold furniture for bedrooms and appliances but the stock soon expanded. In 1912 he moved to larger rooms in _Søndergade_ 27 and later had the building at _Søndergade_ 29 added.
