CLEMENTINE FORD (born 1981) is an Australian feminist writer, broadcaster and public speaker.[1][2][3][4] She wrote a regular column for _Daily Life_[5] for seven years.[6]


Life and career

Ford grew up in Adelaide, South Australia, and as a teenager struggled with an eating disorder.[7] She studied at the University of Adelaide, where she took a gender studies course; she describes this as a personal catalyst for her decision to become a women's rights activist.[8] During her time at the university she also worked as an editor and contributor for the student newspaper _On Dit_.[9][10]

In 2007 Ford began writing a column for Adelaide's _Sunday Mail_, and she also began writing for the Drum.[11][12] Many of her columns were about personal topics and some readers found these controversial. A 2009 article's byline stated that Ford's two abortions had been a "really, really easy decision without guilt or shame".[13]

In 2014, she wrote of her outrage towards comments made by Cory Bernardi that labelled pro-choice advocates "pro-death" soldiers of the "death industry".[14] Later that year, she wrote an opinion piece against a Victorian bill that would change the state's abortion laws, arguing that if politicians really cared about the lives of women and girls, they would advocate for improved access to birth control, including terminations.[15]

On White Ribbon Day in 2015, Ford made public some of the sexist and abusive messages that she had received online.[16] Meriton Group, the employer of a man who had labeled Ford with a derogatory term, investigated Ford's complaint and the man was dismissed from his job.[17] Three Adelaide High School boys were suspended from their school for the lewd comments they wrote about Ford.[18]

In March 2016, Ford was banned from Facebook for 30 days for using profanity toward another user who had verbally abused her on her Facebook page. Ford accused Facebook of having a double standard, as the social networking site meanwhile declined to take action against a user who had posted a graphic internet meme making light of domestic violence.[19]

In September 2016, Allen & Unwin published Ford's first book, _Fight Like a Girl_.[20][21] Two years later, her second book, _Boys Will Be Boys_ was published, which focused on toxic masculinity and the patriarchy.[22]

In 2018 a Lifeline event featuring Ford was cancelled following a petition calling for her removal, after she had made Twitter comments such as "All men must die".[23]

Ford resigned from her role as a columnist with _The Sydney Morning Herald_ and _The Age_ in January 2019, alleging that she had been "disciplined over a tweet" she made in regard to the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, and that she had been told that it was the paper's policy to refrain from "disrespect[ing] the office of the PM".[24]


Personal life

Ford moved from Adelaide to Melbourne in 2011.[25] Ford announced the birth of her son in August 2016.[26][27]
