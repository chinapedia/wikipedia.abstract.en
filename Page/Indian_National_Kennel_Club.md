They also registers dogs that are purebred but whose parents do not carry any papers. These dogs are registered as "purebreds with unknown pedigree".

Pedigree papers (certificates) are issued by the Indian National Kennel Club and are continuously appended as the dog keeps winning championships or changes owners. Pedigree papers are important as they provides lineage and keeps peddling[2] of pedigreed dogs at bay.
