_STOWAWAYS ON THE ARK_ is a 1988 German animated adventure film, released theatrically in Germany as _IN DER ARCHE IST DER WURM DRIN_ by United International Pictures on 24 March 1988. It's inspired by the story of Noah's Ark from the Book of Genesis. The film was later released in the United States and Canada.


Plot

An old woodworm who lives in a very small piece of wood, near the top of a mountain, tells the story of his ancestors...

Willi, the oldest ancestor in the old worm's family tree, lives on a hole in a trunk, alongside his wife, Alice. One day, while both of them are eating in their house, it starts shaking. It turns out that this is one of the many trunks used to build an ark, constructed by a carpenter named Noah, who is discussing with God about the construction plans. God tells him that in the ark, he and his family will be saved and that he has to save a couple from each animal species. Meanwhile, the said trunk gets cut some more so it can be placed in the ark's structure, and the couple starts panicking inside.

The construction finishes and God throws a bottle to the ark, to celebrate. It doesn't break, and he tries harder. It falls into the ark's deck, and termites inside the tapered cork of the bottle get strewed into the deck's floor. God manages to break a second one and instructs some crows to inform the animals about the ark. Then, it's time for him to leave Noah. As Noah and his family help the animals to embark the ark, a female dragon who's carefully holding an egg tries to also embark. However, while attempting to do so, her egg falls and breaks. Now she's not allowed to enter the ship, as she doesn't have a partner.

God sends rain to begin the flood, and the ark starts sailing. Willi discovers some dark tunnels on his way home, and fears that something terrible is going on there. As the days pass, Willi and Alice give birth to a lot of baby woodworms. The bear from the upper deck tries to breathe life into the deck, by having the animals there making music with their sounds, while the one from the under deck tries to prompt the ones there to sing. However, the animals from the upper one get annoyed by the song of the others. After that, the animals are given food to eat, but they aren't pleased with it, and each animal starts blaming the other deck for that.

Willi tells his children, that the whole family needs to search these tunnels. The children do so, but animals from the decks hear them drilling through the wood, and once again, the bears from each deck start suspecting each other's deck for that. This relationship worsens with every happening inside the ark. Noah and his sons also realize that water is entering the storeroom, because of termites. Willi informs his children about the termites, and tell them to spread the word to other animals. They do so, but hardly anyone believes them. Meanwhile, as Willi and his children try to go to the main tunnel at the stern, he sees that the termites have captured his wife. He hears one of his children saying that the ants there can help then, as they release a smell that distracts the termites. Willi and two of his sons drill from where the ants are, to that tunnel, so the termites guarding Alice can get distracted from the smell and Willi can save her.

Suddenly, as the bears insist on blaming each other's deck for whatever is happening, some floors on the ark's inside crumble down, and the animals fall down. Also, the ark starts flooding, and they start panicking. The bears from the upper and under decks find some honey and find out that it's sticky enough to plug the holes. Eventually, they become friends. Noah notices a tumulus of termites located at a part of the deck near the bow. It starts crumbling down and ends up floating in the sea. The animals try to find a way to repair the ark, and a walrus inside the water instructs some whales to drag the ark to land. Noah's sons soon realize that the ark is ashore. With the water level lowered, the animals get debarked and the woodworm couple reunite.

Production

Wolfgang Urchs initially came up with an idea for an adaptation of Candide. After the storyboard was given to the producers Dr. Ute Koll and Dr. Michael Schoemann, it was decided that it was too complex, and the producers tapped Urchs into working out an international story for children.[1] In some scenes, a model of the ark, built by Harald Kraut, one of the film's animators, is shot in live-action to be used via matte work, with live-action water, which is electronically colored.[2] As Kraut says:

The footage shown on the woodworm's TV, are scenes from Battlestar Galactica and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.

A scene depicting an alpaca which can be seen in the English trailer, was deleted from the final cut.[3]


Music

There was a European release of the film's original soundtrack in compact and vinyl discs, published by the Frank Pleyer company, Junior Musikproduktion Frank Pleyer KG. Recordings were made in Elmulab Studio, and Union Studios in Munich, and it was mastered in Tonstudio Ulrich Kraus.[4]

Track listing

Lyrics by Fred Weyrich (tracks 1, 24, 30) and Frank Lenart (tracks 31, 33).

The film was featured at the 22nd Giffoni Film Festival.[5] It is currently available on the German online children's streaming service, KIXI.[6]
