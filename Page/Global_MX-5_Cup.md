The BATTERY TENDER GLOBAL MX-5 CUP is the professional Spec Miata series sanctioned by IndyCar in the United States. The pro Spec Miata series has its roots in 2003, but a unified national championship was launched in 2006.


History

The first generation Mazda MX-5 or Mazda Miata was launched in the U.S. market in May 1989 (model year 1990). The Sports Car Club of America placed the car in the Showroom Stock C class for production vehicles with a 1.600cc engine. The rules allowed the car to be entered in races when the model was one year old, in 1991. As production and popularity of the sports car grew the SCCA developed a separate class for the car. After an exhibition race at Road Atlanta in 1999 an SCCA regional class was launched in 2000. In professional autosport the Miata's were entered in the SCCA World Challenge, but without major results.

Mazdaspeed Miata Cup

The Mazdaspeed Miata Cup was launched for 2003 with a Pacific and an Atlantic championship. The series first race was run at BeaveRun Motorsports Complex on May 3rd and 4th 2003. Chip Herr and Niki Coello won the two races over the weekend.[1] Niki Coello went on to win the Atlantic Tour championship.[2] Bobby Carter won the inaugural Pacific Tour.[3]
