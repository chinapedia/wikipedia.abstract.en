_MAGIC CAT ACADEMY_ is a browser game created as a Google Doodle and released on October 30, 2016.[1] The game, made playable in place of the logo on the Google website, was created in celebration of Halloween.


Story and gameplay

Players control Momo, a sorcerer cat. He goes to a magic school and summons a ghost that steals his spellbook.[2] Momo fights ghosts and bosses throughout five levels, taking place in the school's library, a cafeteria, a classroom, a gymnasium, and on the rooftop. Ghosts are defeated by clicking and swiping the mouse in certain directions, pertaining to the symbol atop the ghosts' heads.[3] The swiping directions include an horizontal line, a vertical line, a "v" shape, a "ÊŒ" shape, and a lightning bolt, the latter-most of which summons lightning that destroys onscreen enemies. On occasion, the player will be allowed to swipe in a heart-like shape to regain health.


Development

The creation of the game was coordinated amongst four different design groups, relating to art design, engineering, production, and music.[4] The original concept for the game involved Momo making soup that resurrects dead spirits.[5] The game's development involved many rejected concepts and ideas, including elaborate symbols to draw (such as a "Cat Hat" spell),[6] as well as boss enemies like a chef ghost and a Venn diagram ghost.[7]

The character of Momo was based on a real-life cat belonging to Google Doodler Juliana Chen.[8][9]
