During the bid for Sha Tin to Central Link (SCL) in 2000s, in order to win the project, Mass Transit Railway proposed to extend the Kwun Tong line while Kowloon–Canton Railway suggest to construct an Automated People Mover in Whampoa.[3][4]

After the MTR–KCR merger in 2007, Hong Kong government appointed MTR to construct the SCL according to KCR proposal, while also extend the Kwun Tong line to Whampoa. The benefits are better transfer arrangement at Ho Man Tin station and other SCL interchange stations.[5]
