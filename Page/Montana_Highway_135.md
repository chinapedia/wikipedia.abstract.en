Route description

MT_135.jpg MT 135 begins in St. Regis at exit 33 along I-90. Almost immediately, it comes to a four-way stop where it intersects the former U.S. Highway 10. From there, the highway heads to the north and northeast through Lolo National Forest and along the northern bank of the Clark Fork River. A line of the Montana Rail Link railroad runs parallel to the highway. Near its midpoint, MT 135 crosses the river and passes beneath the railroad; from there, the road and railroad run along opposite banks of the river. As the river winds, the highway follows closely; near Quinn, the river and road straighten. Just before the highway ends, it exits Lolo National Forest. The highway ends a couple miles east of Paradise at MT 200. Nearby is the mouth of the Clark Fork River, which empties into the Flathead River.[1] {{-}}
