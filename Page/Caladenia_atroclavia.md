_CALADENIA ATROCLAVIA_, commonly known as the BLACK-CLUBBED SPIDER ORCHID, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to south-eastern Queensland. It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and a pale greenish-cream coloured flower with dark purple clubs and red patches on the petals.


Description

_Caladenia atroclavia_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf. The leaf is linear to lance-shaped, long, wide and has irregular red blotches near its base.[1][2]

There is usually only one flower on a wiry, hairy spike high. The flower is pale greenish-cream with red blotches on the petals and is reported to smell like an overheated electric motor. The dorsal sepal is erect, long, about wide, linear to narrow lance-shaped near the base then narrowing to about . The lower part of the dorsal sepal has a reddish stripe in its centre and ends with a thick, dark reddish-purple glandular tip. The lateral sepals are long, about wide, linear to lance-shaped and have a glandular end like the one on the dorsal sepal. The petals are long, about wide, linear to lance shaped with a red line along their centre. The petals and sepals spread widely near their bases but have drooping ends. The labellum is about long and wide and narrow egg-shaped when flattened. It is green and erect in the lower part, then dark maroon and curved nearer the end. There are 6 to 8 linear-shaped teeth along the edges, the longest about but decreasing in size towards the end. There are four rows of dark maroon calli in the centre of the labellum, the longest ones flat-topped and long. The column is long and curved with broad wings. Flowering occurs in October.[3][4][5]


Taxonomy and naming

_Caladenia atroclavia_ was first formally described in 1998 by David Jones and Mark Clements and the description was published in _Austrobaileya_. The type specimen was collected near Wyberba in the Darling Downs district.[6][7] The specific epithet (atroclavia) is derived from the Latin words _atra_ meaning "black"[8] and _clavia_ meaning "club-bearing",[9] referring to the prominent dark-coloured ends of the sepals[10]


Distribution and habitat

This caladenia grows in well-drained gravel derived from granite in woodland and swampy areas. Only four populations with a total of about 70 plants are known, occurring in the Girraween National Park and in the Wyberba area.[11][12]


Conservation

_Caladenia atroclavia_ is classified as "Endangered" under the Queensland Government _Nature Conservation Act_ and the Commonwealth Government _Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999_ (EPBC) Act.[13][14] The main threat to its survival is the feral pig _Sus scrofa_.


Ecology

Research at the University of Southern Queensland has shown that the mycorrhizal fungus associated with this species of orchid belongs to the Sebacinaceae complex.[15]
