History

In the late 1970s,[2] Larry and Laverne Kreider started a small group Bible study to reach unchurched youth in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The Kreiders were unable to connect these youth to local churches in their area. Larry Kreider began an "underground church" in response to this problem.[3]

Kreider recruited some young couples to help in leadership of small groups. These groups met together in a large living room for their first Sunday Morning celebration in October 1980. DOVE Christian Fellowship was born.[4]

FIRST TEN YEARS - DOVE Christian Fellowship grew to over 2,000 believers scattered throughout a seven-county region of Pennsylvania. More than one hundred small groups met during the week and on Sunday mornings.[5]

SMALL GROUP CHURCHES EMERGE 1996 - Eight small group-based churches were created from the one. Included were three other small group churches in Kenya, Uganda and New Zealand. The leadership of these churches were turned over to "senior elders".[6]

THE APOSTOLIC COUNCIL, LED BY LARRY KREIDER, was created to train, oversee and mentor new local leaders throughout the world.☃☃ The council oversees the DOVE International family of churches and includes leaders actively involved with the ministry.[7]

The Members of the APOSTOLIC COUNCIL are LARRY and LaVerne Kreider, RON and Bonnie Myer, PETER and Ruth Ann Bunton, CHAD and Chris Miller, HESBONE and Violet Odindo, IBRAHIM and DIANE Omondi, STEVE and Mary Prokopchak, and BRIAN and Janet Sauder.[8]
