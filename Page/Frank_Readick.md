FRANK MARVIN READICK JR. (November 6, 1896, Seattle, Washington â€” December 27, 1965[1]) was an American radio and film actor.[2]

He is well known for his evil laughter followed the introduction from _The Shadow_ radio drama: "Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!". Readick replaced James La Curto to perform The Shadow narrator in the _Detective Story Hour_ (the precursor of _The Shadow_) in 1930, four months after the launch of the series when La Curto went for a Broadway role.[3] This signature line remained intact in _The Shadow_ even after Orson Welles succeeded Readick.[4][5]

He later played the doomed CBS reporter Carl Phillips in the 1938 radio production of _The War of the Worlds_. Readick modeled his performance on WLS reporter Herbert Morrison's coverage of the Hindenburg disaster the previous year.

Readick would later appear alongside his _War of the World_s co-star and Mercury Theatre director Orson Welles in _Citizen Kane_ (1941) and _Journey into Fear_ (1943).

He was also known for _House of Mystery_ (1931) and _A Burglar to the Rescue_ (1931).

He died in 1965 in the USA.
