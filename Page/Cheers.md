_CHEERS_ is an American sitcom that ran on NBC from September 30, 1982, to May 20, 1993, with a total of 275 half-hour episodes for eleven seasons. The show was produced by Charles/Burrows/Charles Productions in association with Paramount Network Television. The show was created by the team of James Burrows, Glen Charles, and Les Charles. The show is set in a bar named Cheers in Boston, Massachusetts, where a group of locals meet to drink, relax, and socialize. The show's main theme song, co-written and performed by Gary Portnoy, lent its refrain "Where Everybody Knows Your Name" as the show's catchphrase.[1]

After premiering on September 30, 1982, it was nearly canceled during its first season when it ranked almost last in ratings for its premiere (74th out of 77 shows). _Cheers_, however, eventually became a highly rated television show in the United States, earning a top-ten rating during eight of its eleven seasons, including one season at number one. The show spent most of its run on NBC's Thursday night "Must See TV" lineup. Its widely watched series finale was broadcast on May 20, 1993, and the show's 275 episodes have been successfully syndicated worldwide. Nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series for all eleven of its seasons on the air, it earned 28 Primetime Emmy Awards from a record of 117 nominations. The character Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) was featured in his eponymous spin-off show, which aired until 2004 and included guest appearances by virtually all of the major and minor _Cheers_ characters.

During its run, _Cheers_ became one of the most popular series of all time and has received critical acclaim from its start to its end. In 1997, the episodes "Thanksgiving Orphans" and "Home Is the Sailor", aired originally in 1987, were respectively ranked No. 7 and No. 45 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time.[2] In 2002, _Cheers_ was ranked No. 18 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.[3] In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it as the eighth best written TV series[4] and _TV Guide_ ranked it No. 11 on their list of the 60 Greatest Shows of All Time.[5]


Characters

Before the _Cheers_ pilot "Give Me a Ring Sometime" was completed and aired in 1982, the series originally consisted of four employees in the first script.[6] Neither Norm Peterson nor Cliff Clavin, regular customers of Cheers, were featured; later revisions added them as among the regular characters of the series.[7]

In later years, Woody Boyd replaces Coach, who dies off-screen in season four (1985–86) due to actor Nicholas Colasanto's death. Frasier Crane starts as a recurring character and becomes a permanent character. In season six (1987–88), they added a new character Rebecca Howe, who was written into the show after the finale of the previous season (1986–87). Lilith Sternin starts as a one-time character in an episode of season four, "Second Time Around" (1985). After she appears in two episodes in season five, she becomes a recurring character, and later featured as a permanent one for season ten (1991–92).

-   Ted Danson portrays SAM MALONE, a bartender of Cheers. Sam is also a lothario. Before the series began, he was a baseball relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox nicknamed "Mayday Malone" until he became an alcoholic, harming his career. He has an on-again, off-again relationship with Diane Chambers, his class opposite, in the first five seasons (1982–1987). During their off-times, Sam has flings with many not-so-bright "sexy women",[8] yet fails to pursue a meaningful relationship[9] and fails to seduce other women, such as intellectuals. After Diane is written out of the series, he tries to pursue Rebecca Howe, with varying results. At the end of the series, he is still unmarried and faces sexual addiction with the help of Dr. Robert Sutton's (Gilbert Lewis) group meetings, advised by Frasier.
-   Shelley Long portrays DIANE CHAMBERS, an academic, sophisticated graduate student attending Boston University.[10] In the pilot, Diane is abandoned by her fiancé, leaving her without a job, a man, or money. Therefore, she reluctantly becomes a Bar maid. Later, she becomes a close friend of Coach[11] and has an on-and-off relationship with bartender Sam Malone, her class opposite. During their off-relationship times, Diane dates men who fit her upper-class ideals, such as Frasier Crane. In 1987, she leaves Boston behind for a writing career and to live in Los Angeles, California. Diane returns to Cheers to cure Sam of his drinking. Diane's biggest enemy is Carla but Diane doesn't insult Carla the way Carla does Diane which annoys Carla even more.
-   Nicholas Colasanto portrays COACH ERNIE PANTUSSO, a "borderline senile"[12] co-bartender, widower, and retired baseball coach. Coach is also a friend of Sam and a close friend of Diane. He has a daughter, Lisa (Allyce Beasley). Coach listens to people's problems and solves them. However, other people also help resolve his own problems. In 1985, Coach died without explicit explanation, as Colasanto died of a heart attack.[13]
-   Rhea Perlman portrays CARLA TORTELLI, a "wisecracking, cynical"[14] cocktail waitress, who treats customers badly. She is also highly fertile and matrimonially inept. When the series premiered, she is the mother of four children by her ex-husband Nick Tortelli (Dan Hedaya). Over the course of the series, she bears four more, the depiction of which incorporated Perlman's real-life pregnancies.[15] All of her children are notoriously ill-behaved, except Ludlow, whose father is a prominent academic. She flirts with men, including ones who are not flattered by her ways, and believes in superstitions. Later she marries Eddie LeBec, an ice hockey player, who later becomes a penguin mascot for ice shows. After he died in an ice show accident by an ice resurfacer, Carla later discovers that Eddie had committed bigamy with another woman, whom he had gotten pregnant. Carla sleeps with Sam's enemy John Hill to Sam's annoyance and anger.
-   George Wendt portrays NORM PETERSON, a bar regular and occasionally-employed accountant. A recurrent joke on the show, especially in the earlier seasons, was that the character was such a popular and constant fixture at the bar that anytime he entered through the front door everyone present would yell out his name ("NORM!") in greeting; usually this cry would be followed by one of the present bartenders asking Norm how he was, usually receiving a sardonic response and a request for a beer. He has infrequent accounting jobs and a troubled marriage with (but is still in love with and married to) Vera, an unseen character. Later in the series, he becomes a house painter and an interior decorator. Later in the series, Norm secures his dream job, tasting beer at a brewery. The character was not originally intended to be a main cast role;[16] Wendt auditioned for a minor role of George for the pilot episode. The role was to only be Diane Chambers' first customer and had only one word: "Beer!"[17] After he was cast in a more permanent role, the character was renamed Norm.[18]
-   John Ratzenberger portrays CLIFF CLAVIN, a know-it-all bar regular and mail carrier. He lives with his mother Esther Clavin (Frances Sternhagen) in first the family house and later an apartment. In the bar, Cliff continuously spouts nonsensical and annoying trivia, making him an object of derision to the bar patrons. Ratzenberger auditioned for the role of a minor character George, but it went to Wendt, evolving the role into Norm Peterson.[19] The producers decided they wanted a resident bar know-it-all,[20] so the security guard Cliff Clavin was added for the pilot. The producers changed his occupation into a mail carrier as they thought such a man would have wider knowledge than a guard.[21]

Subsequent main characters

-   Kelsey Grammer portrays FRASIER CRANE, a psychiatrist and bar regular. Frasier started out as Diane Chambers' love interest in the third season (1984–85). In the fourth season (1985–86), after Diane jilts him at the altar in Europe, Frasier ends up frequenting Cheers and becomes a regular. He later marries Lilith Sternin and has a son, Frederick. After the series ends the character becomes the focus of the spin-off _Frasier_, in which he is divorced from Lilith and living in Seattle.
-   Woody Harrelson portrays WOODY BOYD, a not-so-bright[22] bartender. He arrives from his Midwest hometown of Hanover, Indiana to Boston, to see Coach, his "pen pal" (as referring to exchanging "pens", not letters). When Sam tells Woody that Coach died, Sam hires Woody in Coach's place. Later, he marries his girlfriend Kelly Gaines (Jackie Swanson), also not-so-bright but raised in a rich family. In the final season, he runs for political office, and surprisingly wins.
-   Bebe Neuwirth portrays LILITH STERNIN, a psychiatrist and bar regular. She is often teased by bar patrons about her uptight personality and appearance. In "Second Time Around" (1986), her first episode, also her only one of the fourth season, her date with Frasier does not go well because they constantly argue. In the fifth season, with help from Diane, Lilith and Frasier begin a relationship. Eventually, they marry and have a son, Frederick. In the eleventh and final season, she leaves Frasier to live with another man in an experimental underground environment called the "Eco-pod." She returns later in the season and reconciles with Frasier. However, in the spinoff _Frasier_, Lilith divorces Frasier and bears the custody of Frederick.
-   Kirstie Alley portrays REBECCA HOWE. She starts out as a strong independent woman, manager of the bar for the corporation that Sam bought after Diane jilted him. Eventually, when Sam regains ownership, she begs him to let her remain as cocktail waitress. She repeatedly has romantic failures with mainly rich men and becomes more and "more neurotic, insecure, and sexually frustrated".[23] At the start, Sam frequently attempts to seduce Rebecca without success.[24] As her personality changes,[25] he loses interest in her. In the series finale, Rebecca marries the plumber Don Santry (played by Tom Berenger) and quits working for the bar. In the _Frasier_ episode "The Show Where Sam Shows Up", she is revealed to be divorced and back at the bar. When Frasier asks if this is to mean she is working there again Sam says no, she's just "back at the bar."

Before production of season 3 was finished, Nicholas Colasanto died. Therefore, his character Coach was written out as deceased in season 4.[28]
^(*)In season 11, Bebe Neuwirth is given "starring" credit only when she appears.

Recurring characters

Although _Cheers_ operated largely around that main ensemble cast, guest stars and recurring characters did occasionally supplement them. Notable repeat guests included Dan Hedaya as Nick Tortelli and Jean Kasem as Loretta Tortelli, who were the main characters in the first spin-off _The Tortellis_, Fred Dryer as Dave Richards, Annie Golden as Margaret O'Keefe, Derek McGrath as Andy Schroeder (also referred to as _Andy Andy_), interchangeably Joel Polis and Robert Desiderio as rival bar owner Gary, Jay Thomas as Eddie LeBec, Roger Rees as Robin Colcord, Tom Skerritt as Evan Drake, Frances Sternhagen as Esther Clavin, Richard Doyle as Walter Gaines, Keene Curtis as John Allen Hill, Anthony Cistaro as Henri, Michael McGuire as Professor Sumner Sloan, and Harry Anderson as Harry 'The Hat' Gittes. Jackie Swanson, who played the recurring role of Woody's girlfriend and eventual wife "Kelly Gaines-Boyd", appeared in 24 episodes from 1989 to 1993. The character is as equally dim and naive—but ultimately as sweet-natured—as Woody.

Paul Willson played the recurring barfly character of "Paul Krapence". (In one early appearance in the first season he was called "Glen", and was later credited on-screen as "Gregg" and "Tom", but he was playing the same character throughout.) Thomas Babson played "Tom", a law student often mocked by Cliff Clavin, for continually failing to pass the Massachusetts bar exam. "Al", played by Al Rosen, appeared in 38 episodes, and was known for his surly quips. Rhea Perlman's father Philip Perlman played the role of "Phil".[29]

Celebrity appearances

Other celebrities guest-starred in single episodes as themselves throughout the series. Sports figures appeared on the show as themselves with a connection to Boston or Sam's former team, the Red Sox, such as Luis Tiant, Wade Boggs and Kevin McHale (of the Boston Celtics).[30] Some television stars also made guest appearances as themselves such as Alex Trebek, Arsenio Hall, Dick Cavett, Robert Urich, George "Spanky" McFarland and Johnny Carson. Various political figures even made appearances on _Cheers_ such as then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral William J. Crowe, former Colorado Senator Gary Hart, then-Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, then-Senator John Kerry, then-Governor Michael Dukakis, Ethel Kennedy (widow of Robert F. Kennedy), and then-Mayor of Boston Raymond Flynn, the last five of whom all represented Cheers' home state and city.

In maternal roles, Glynis Johns, in a guest appearance in 1983, played Diane's mother, Helen Chambers. Nancy Marchand played Frasier's mother, Hester Crane, in an episode that aired in 1985. In an episode that aired in 1992, Celeste Holm played Kelly's jokester of a paternal grandmother. Melendy Britt appeared in the episode "_Woody or Won't He_" (1990) as Kelly's mother, Roxanne Gaines, a very attractive high-society lady and a sexy, flirtatious upper-class cougar who tries to seduce Woody.

The musician Harry Connick, Jr. appeared in an episode as Woody's cousin and plays a song from his Grammy-winning album _We Are in Love_ (c. 1991). John Cleese won a Primetime Emmy Award for his guest appearance as "Dr. Simon Finch-Royce" in the fifth-season episode, "Simon Says". Emma Thompson guest starred as Nanny G/Nannette Guzman, a famous singing nanny and Frasier's ex-wife. Christopher Lloyd guest starred as a tortured artist who wanted to paint Diane. Marcia Cross portrayed Rebecca's sister Susan in the season 7 episode _Sisterly Love_. John Mahoney once appeared as an inept jingle writer, which included a brief conversation with Frasier Crane, whose father he later portrayed on the spin-off _Frasier_. Peri Gilpin, who later played Roz Doyle on _Frasier,_ also appeared in one episode of _Cheers_, in its 11th season, as Holly Matheson, a reporter who interviews Woody. The Righteous Brothers, Bobby Hatfield and Bill Medley, also guest starred in different episodes. In "The Guy Can't Help It" Rebecca, meets a plumber played by Tom Berenger who came to fix one of the beer keg taps. They marry in the series finale, triggering her resignation from Cheers.

Notable guest appearances of actresses portraying Sam's sexual conquests or potential sexual conquests include: Kate Mulgrew in the three-episode finale of season four, portraying Boston councilwoman Janet Eldridge; Donna McKechnie as Debra, Sam's ex-wife (with whom he is on good terms), who pretends to be an intellectual in front of Diane; Barbara Babcock as Lana Marshall, a talent agent who specializes in representing male athletes, her clients with whom she routinely sleeps on demand; Julia Duffy as Rebecca Prout, a depressed intellectual friend of Diane's; Alison La Placa as magazine reporter Paula Nelson; Carol Kane as Amanda, who Sam eventually learns was a fellow patient at the sanitarium with Diane; Barbara Feldon as Lauren Hudson, Sam's annual Valentine's Day fling (in an homage to _Same Time, Next Year_); Sandahl Bergman as Judy Marlowe, a longtime casual sex partner and whose now grown daughter, Laurie Marlowe (Chelsea Noble), who has always considered Sam a pseudo-father figure, Sam falls for; Madolyn Smith-Osborne as Dr. Sheila Rydell, a colleague of Frasier and Lilith; Valerie Mahaffey as Valerie Hill, John Allen Hill's daughter who Sam pursues if only to gain an upper hand in his business relationship with Hill; and Alexis Smith as Alice Anne Volkman, Rebecca's much older ex-professor. In season 9, episode 17, _I'm Getting My Act Together and Sticking It in Your Face_, Sam, believing Rebecca wants a more serious relationship, pretends to be gay, his lover being a casual friend named Leon (Jeff McCarthy) – the plan ultimately leads to a kiss between Sam and Leon.

Death of Nicholas Colasanto

Near the end of production of the third season, the writers of _Cheers_ had to deal with the death of one of the main actors. During the third season, Nicholas Colasanto's heart condition (which had been diagnosed in the mid-1970s) had worsened. He had lost weight and was having trouble breathing during filming. Shortly before third season filming wrapped, Colasanto was hospitalized due to fluid in his lungs. Though he recovered, he was not cleared to return to work. While visiting the set in January 1985 to watch the filming of several episodes, co-star Shelley Long commented, "I think we were all in denial. We were all glad he was there, but he lost a lot of weight." Co-star Rhea Perlman added, "[He] wanted to be there so badly. He didn't want to be sick. He couldn't breathe well. It was hard. He was laboring all the time." Colasanto ultimately died of a heart attack at his home on February 12, 1985.[31]

The third-season episodes of _Cheers_ were filmed out of order, partly to accommodate the pregnancy of cast member Long. As a result, the season finale, which included several scenes with Colasanto, had already been filmed at the time of his death. In the third-season episodes that had not been filmed at this point, Coach is said to be "away" for various reasons.

The _Cheers_ writing staff assembled in June 1985, at the start of the production of the fourth season, to discuss how to deal with the absence of Coach. They quickly discarded the idea that he might have moved away, as they felt he would never abandon his friends. In addition, as most viewers were aware of Colasanto's death, the writing staff decided to handle the situation more openly. The season four opener, "Birth, Death, Love and Rice", dealt with Coach's death as well as introduced Woody Harrelson, Colasanto's replacement.[32][33]


Episodes


Themes

Nearly all of _Cheers_ took place in the front room of the bar, but the characters often went into the rear pool room or the bar's office.[34] _Cheers_ did not show any action outside the bar until the first episode of the second season, which took place in Diane's apartment.

The show's main theme in its early seasons was the romance between intellectual waitress Diane Chambers and the bar's owner Sam Malone, a former major league baseball pitcher for the Boston Red Sox and a recovering alcoholic.[35] After Shelley Long (Diane) left the show, the focus shifted to Sam's new relationship with Rebecca Howe, a neurotic corporate-ladder climber.

Many _Cheers_ scripts centered or touched upon a variety of social issues, albeit humorously. As _Toasting Cheers_ puts it, "The script was further strengthened by the writers' boldness in successfully tackling controversial issues such as alcoholism, homosexuality, and adultery."[36]

Social class was a subtext of the show. The "upper class" – represented by characters like Diane Chambers, Frasier Crane and Lilith Sternin – rubbed shoulders with middle and working-class characters – Sam Malone, Carla Tortelli, Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin. An extreme example of this was the relationship between Woody Boyd and a millionaire's daughter, Kelly Gaines. Many viewers enjoyed _Cheers_ in part because of this focus on character development in addition to plot development.[37]

Feminism and the role of women were also recurring themes throughout the show, with some critics seeing each of the major female characters portraying an aspect as a flawed feminist in her own way.[38] Diane was a vocal feminist, and Sam was the epitome of everything she hated: a womanizer and a male chauvinist. (See "Sam and Diane".)

Homosexuality was dealt with from the first season, which was rare in the early 1980s on American television.[39] In the first-season episode "The Boys in the Bar" (the title being a reference to the play and subsequent movie _The Boys in the Band_), a friend and former teammate of Sam's comes out in his autobiography. Some of the male regulars pressure Sam to take action to ensure that Cheers does not become a gay bar. The episode won a GLAAD Media Award, and the script's writers, Ken Levine and David Isaacs, were nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award.

Addiction also plays a role in _Cheers_, almost exclusively through Sam. He is a recovering alcoholic who had bought a bar during his drinking days. Frasier has a notable bout of drinking in the fourth-season episode "The Triangle", while Woody develops a gambling problem in the seventh season's "Call Me Irresponsible".


Cheers owners

Cheers had several owners before Sam, as the bar was opened in 1889. The "Est. 1895" on the bar's sign is a made-up date chosen by Carla for numerological purposes, revealed in season 8, episode 6, "The Stork Brings a Crane", which also revealed the bar's address as 112 1/2 Beacon Street and that it originated under the name Mom's. In the series' second episode, "Sam's Women", Coach tells a customer looking for Gus, the owner of Cheers, that Gus was dead. In a later episode, Gus O'Mally comes back from Arizona for one night and helps run the bar.

The biggest storyline surrounding the ownership of Cheers begins in the fifth-season finale, "I Do, Adieu", when Sam and Diane part ways, due to Shelley Long's departure from the series. In addition, Sam leaves on a trip to sail around the world. Before he leaves, Sam sells Cheers to the Lillian Corporation. He returns in the sixth-season premiere, "Home is the Sailor", having sunk his boat, to find the bar under the new management of Rebecca Howe. He begs for his job back and is hired by Rebecca as a bartender. In the seventh-season premiere, "How to Recede in Business", Rebecca is fired and Sam is promoted to manager. Rebecca is allowed to keep a job at Lillian vaguely similar to what she had before, but only after Sam had Rebecca (in absentia) "agree" to a long list of demands that the corporation had for her.

From there Sam occasionally attempted to buy the bar back with schemes that usually involved the wealthy executive Robin Colcord. Sam acquired Cheers again in the eighth-season finale, when it was sold back to him for 85¢ by the Lillian Corporation, after he alerted the company to Colcord's insider trading. Fired by the corporation because of her silence on the issue, Rebecca is hired by Sam as a hostess/office manager. For the rest of the episode, to celebrate Sam's reclaiming the bar, a huge banner hung from the staircase, reading "Under OLD Management"!

Sam had two main battles, one with Gary's Olde Towne Tavern, trying to beat them at some activity or another but always failing, extending to the practical jokes they played on each other. The second was with Melville's Owner John Hill who kept annoying Sam with his pettiness and ego. Hill had an ongoing relationship with Carla.


Production

, formerly the Bull & Finch Pub, in Boston in 2005.]]

Creation and concept

Three men developed and created the _Cheers_ television series: The Charles brothers—Glen and Les—and James Burrows,[40] who identified themselves as "two Mormons and a Jew."[41] They aimed at "creating a show around a Spencer Tracy-Katharine Hepburn-type relationship" between their two main characters, Sam Malone and Diane Chambers.[42] Malone represents the average man, while Chambers represents class and sophistication.[43] The show revolves around characters in a bar under "humorous adult themes" and "situations."[44]

The original idea was a group of workers who interacted like a family, the goal being a concept similar to _The Mary Tyler Moore Show_. The creators considered making an American version of the British _Fawlty Towers,_ set in a hotel or an inn. When the creators settled on a bar as their setting, the show began to resemble the radio show _Duffy's Tavern,_ a program originally written and co-created by James Burrows' father Abe Burrows. They liked the idea of a tavern, as it provided a continuous stream of new people, for a variety of characters.[45]

Early discussions about the location of the show centered on Barstow, California, then Kansas City, Missouri. They eventually turned to the East Coast and finally Boston. The Bull & Finch Pub in Boston, which was the model for Cheers, was chosen from a phone book.[46] When Glen Charles asked the bar's owner, Tom Kershaw, to shoot exterior and interior photos, he agreed, charging $1. Kershaw has since gone on to make millions of dollars, licensing the pub's image and selling a variety of _Cheers_ memorabilia. The Bull & Finch became the 42nd busiest outlet in the American food and beverage industry in 1997.[47] During initial casting, Shelley Long, who was in Boston at the time filming _A Small Circle of Friends_, remarked that the bar in the script resembled a bar she had come upon in the city, which turned out to be the Bull & Finch.[48]

Production team

The crew of _Cheers_ numbered in the hundreds. The three creators—James Burrows and the Charles brothers, Glen and Les—kept offices on Paramount's lot for the duration of the _Cheers_ run. The Charles Brothers remained in overall charge throughout the show's run, frequently writing major episodes, though starting with the third season they began delegating the day-to-day running of the writing staff to various showrunners. Ken Estin and Sam Simon were appointed as showrunners for the third season, and succeeded by David Angell, Peter Casey and David Lee the following year. Angell, Casey and Lee would remain as showrunners until the end of the seventh season when they left to develop their own sitcom, _Wings_, and were replaced by Cheri Eichen, Bill Steinkellner and Phoef Sutton for the eighth through tenth seasons. For the final season, Tom Anderson and Dan O'Shannon acted as the showrunners.

James Burrows is regarded as being a factor in the show's longevity, directing 243 of the 270 episodes and supervising the show's production.[49] Among the show's other directors were Andy Ackerman, Thomas Lofaro, Tim Berry, Tom Moore, Rick Beren, as well as cast members John Ratzenberger and George Wendt.[50]

Craig Safan provided the series' original music for its entire run except the theme song. His extensive compositions for the show led to him winning numerous ASCAP Top TV Series awards for his music.

Casting

The character of Sam Malone was originally intended to be a retired football player and was slated to be played by Fred Dryer, but, after casting Ted Danson, it was decided that a former baseball player (Sam "Mayday" Malone) would be more believable.[51][52] Dryer, however, would go on to play sportscaster Dave Richards, an old friend of Sam, in three episodes. The character of Cliff Clavin was created for John Ratzenberger after he auditioned for the role of Norm Peterson, which eventually went to George Wendt. While chatting with producers afterward, he asked if they were going to include a "bar know-it-all", the part which he eventually played.[53] Alley joined the cast when Shelley Long left, and Woody Harrelson joined when Nicholas Colasanto died. Danson, Perlman and Wendt were the only actors to appear in every episode of the series; Ratzenberger appears in all but one.

Filming styles and locations

Most _Cheers_ episodes were, as a voiceover stated at the start of each, "filmed before a live studio audience" on Paramount Stage 25 in Hollywood, generally on Tuesday nights. Scripts for a new episode were issued the Wednesday before for a read-through, Friday was rehearsal day, and final scripts were issued on Monday. Burrows, who directed most episodes, insisted on using film stock rather than videotape. He was also noted for using motion in his directorial style, trying to constantly keep characters moving rather than standing still.[54] During the first season when ratings were poor Paramount and NBC asked that the show use videotape to save money, but a poor test taping ended the experiment and _Cheers_ continued to use film.[55]

Due to a decision by Glen and Les Charles, the cold open was often not connected to the rest of the episode, with the lowest-ranked writers assigned to create the jokes for them. Some cold opens were taken from episodes that ran too long.[56]

The first year of the show took place entirely within the confines of the bar, the first location outside the bar being Diane's apartment. When the series became a hit, the characters started venturing further afield, first to other sets and eventually to an occasional exterior location. The exterior location shots of the bar were of the Bull & Finch Pub, located directly north of the Boston Public Garden. The pub has become a tourist attraction because of its association with the series, and draws nearly one million visitors annually.[57][58] It has since been renamed Cheers Beacon Hill; its interior is different from the TV bar. The Pub itself is at 84 Beacon Street (on the corner of Brimmer St). In August 2001, there was a replica made of the bar in Faneuil Hall to capitalize on the popularity of the show.

Theme song

Before "Where Everybody Knows Your Name", written by Gary Portnoy and Judy Hart Angelo, became the show's theme song, _Cheers_{{'}} producers rejected two of Portnoy's and Hart Angelo's songs. The songwriters had collaborated to provide music for _Preppies_, an unsuccessful Broadway musical. When told they could not appropriate "People Like Us", _Preppies_{{'}} opening song, the pair wrote another song "My Kind of People", which resembled "People Like Us" and intended to satirize "the lifestyle of old decadent old-money WASPs," but, to meet producers' demands, they rewrote the lyrics to be about "likeable losers" in a Boston bar. The show's producers rejected this song, as well. After they read the script of the series pilot, they created another song "Another Day". When Portnoy and Hart Angelo heard that NBC had commissioned thirteen episodes, they created an official theme song "Where Everybody Knows Your Name" and rewrote the lyrics.[59] On syndicated airings of _Cheers_, the theme song was shortened to make room for commercials.


Reception

Critical reception

_Cheers_ was critically acclaimed in its first season, though it landed a disappointing 74th out of 77 shows in that year's ratings.[60] This critical support, the early success at the Primetime Emmy Awards, and the support of the president of NBC's entertainment division Brandon Tartikoff, are thought to be the main reasons for the show's survival and eventual success.[61] Tartikoff stated in 1983 that _Cheers_ was a sophisticated adult comedy and that NBC executives, "never for a second doubted" that the show would not be renewed.[62] Writer Levine believes that the most important reason was that the network recognized that it did not have other hit shows to help promote _Cheers_; as he later wrote, "[NBC] had nothing else better to replace it with."[63]

In 2013, _GQ_ magazine held an online competition to find the best TV comedy. _Cheers_ was voted the greatest comedy show of all time.[64] In 2017, James Charisma of __Paste_ (magazine)_ ranked the show's opening sequence No. 5 on a list of _The 75 Best TV Title Sequences of All Time_.[65]

Ratings

Ratings improved for the summer reruns after the first season.[66] The cast went on various talk shows to try to further promote the series after its first season. By the second season _Cheers_ was competitive with CBS' top rated show _Simon & Simon_.[67] With the growing popularity of _Family Ties_, which ran in the slot ahead of _Cheers_ from January 1984 until _Family Ties_ was moved to Sundays in 1987, and the placement of _The Cosby Show_ in front of both at the start of their third season (1984), the line-up became a runaway ratings success that NBC eventually dubbed "Must See Thursday". The next season, _Cheers_ ratings increased dramatically after Woody Boyd became a regular character as well. By the end of its final season, the show had a run of eight consecutive seasons in the Top Ten of the Nielsen ratings; seven of them were in the Top Five.[68]

NBC dedicated a whole night to the final episode of _Cheers_, following the one-hour season finale of _Seinfeld_ (which was its lead-in). The show began with a "pregame" show hosted by Bob Costas, followed by the final 98-minute episode itself. NBC affiliates then aired tributes to _Cheers_ during their local newscasts, and the night concluded with a special _Tonight Show_ broadcast live from the Bull & Finch Pub. Although the episode fell short of its hyped ratings predictions to become the most watched television episode, it was the most watched show that year, bringing in 93.5 million viewers (64 percent of all viewers that night), and ranked 11th all time in entertainment programming. The 1993 final broadcast of _Cheers_ also emerged as the highest rated broadcast of NBC to date, as well as the most watched single episode from any television series throughout the decade 1990s on U.S. television.[69][70][71][72]

The episode originally aired in the usual _Cheers_ spot of Thursday night, and was then rebroadcast on Sunday. While the original broadcast did not outperform the _M*A*S*H_ finale, the combined non-repeating audiences for the Thursday and Sunday showings did. It should also be noted that television had greatly changed between the two finales, leaving _Cheers_ with a broader array of competition for ratings.[73]

NBC timeslots:

-   Season 1 Episodes 1–12: Thursday at 9:00 pm
-   Season 1 Episode 13-Season 2 Episode 10: Thursday at 9:30 pm
-   Season 2 Episode 11-Season 11 Episode 28: Thursday at 9:00 pm

Serialized storylines

_Cheers_ was perhaps the first sitcom with a serialized storyline,[74] starting with the third season. The show's success helped make such multi-episode story arcs popular on television, which Les Charles regrets.

  [W]e may have been partly responsible for what's going on now, where if you miss the first episode or two, you are lost. You have to wait until you can get the whole thing on DVD and catch up with it. If that blood is on our hands, I feel kind of badly about it. It can be very frustrating."

_Cheers_ began with a limited five-character ensemble consisting of Ted Danson, Shelley Long, Rhea Perlman, Nicholas Colasanto and George Wendt. By the time season 10 began, the show had eight front characters in its roster. _Cheers_ was also able to gradually phase in characters such as Cliff, Frasier, Lilith, Rebecca, and Woody.

Awards and honors

Over its eleven-season run, the _Cheers_ cast and crew earned many awards. The show garnered a record 111 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, with a total of 28 wins. In addition, _Cheers_ earned 31 Golden Globe nominations, with a total of six wins. Danson, Long, Alley, Perlman, Wendt, Ratzenberger, Harrelson, Grammer, Neuwirth, and Colasanto all received Emmy nominations for their roles. _Cheers_ won the Golden Globe Award for "Best TV-Series – Comedy/Musical" in 1991 and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1983, 1984, 1989, and 1991. The series was presented with the "Legend Award" at the 2006 TV Land Awards, with many of the surviving cast members attending the event.[75]

The following are awards that have been earned by the _Cheers_ cast and crew over its 11-season run:

Distribution

Syndication

_Cheers_ grew in popularity as it aired on American television and entered into off-network syndication in 1987, initially distributed by Paramount Domestic Television. When the show went off the air in 1993, _Cheers_ was syndicated in 38 countries with 179 American television markets and 83 million viewers.[76] When the quality of some earlier footage of _Cheers_ began to deteriorate, it underwent a careful restoration in 2001 due to its continued success.[77] The series aired on Nick at Nite from 2001 to 2004 and on TV Land from 2004 to 2008.[78] with Nick at Nite airing week long _Cheers_ "Everybody Knows Your Name" marathons. The show was removed from the lineup in 2004. The series began airing on Hallmark Channel in the United States in October 2008, and WGN America in 2009, where it continues to air on both channels. In January 2011, Reelz Channel began airing the series in hour-long blocks. Me-TV began airing _Cheers_ weeknights in 2010. More recently, USA Network is rerunning the series on Sunday early mornings and weekday mornings to allow it to show extended length films of 2 1/2 hours and maintain symmetric schedules.

As of April 2011, Netflix began including _Cheers_ as one of the titles on its "watch instantly" streaming service. Amazon added it to its Prime service in July.[79]

A _Cheers_ rerun notably replaced the September 4, 1992 airing of _Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos_ on Australia's Nine Network. The latter was canceled mid-episode on its only broadcast by Kerry Packer, who pulled the plug after a phone call. It was repeated several years later on the Nine Network shortly after Packer's death in 2005. _Cheers_ currently airs on Eleven (a digital channel of Network Ten) starting January 11, 2011 in Australia. When _Cheers_ was aired by NCRV in the Netherlands, they showed all 275 episodes in sequence, once per night, repeating the series a total of three times.

As of 2012, _Cheers_ has been repeated on UK satellite channel CBS Drama. Cheers is also shown on the UK free-to-air channel ITV4 where it is shown two episodes every weekday night. Because of the ITV syndication it is also available to watch on the online ITV Player for seven days after broadcast. On March 16, 2015, the series began airing on UK subscription channel Gold on weekdays at 9:30 am and 10:00 am. Cheers then aired in 2019 on Channel 4, which had previously aired the network in 2002.

They are also currently airing on ReelzChannel.

High definition

A high-definition transfer of _Cheers_ began running on HDNet in the United States in August 2010. Originally shot on film (but transferred to and edited on videotape) the program was broadcast in a 4:3 aspect ratio, the newly transferred versions are in 16:9. However, in the United Kingdom, the HD repeats on ITV4 HD are shown in the original 4:3 aspect ratio.

Home media

Paramount Home Entertainment and (from 2006 onward) CBS Home Entertainment have released all 11 seasons of _Cheers_ on DVD in Region 1, Region 2 and Region 4. In the US, the last three seasons had music substitutions. In "Grease", "I Fought the Law" was replaced; its removal affected the comedic value of the scenes it was originally in.

On March 6, 2012, they released _Fan Favorites: The Best of Cheers_. Based on the 2012 Facebook poll, the selected episodes are:[80]

1.  "Give Me a Ring Sometime" (season 1, episode 1)
2.  "Diane's Perfect Date" (season 1, episode 17)
3.  "Pick a Con, Any Con" (season 1, episode 19)
4.  "Abnormal Psychology" (season 5, episode 4)
5.  "Thanksgiving Orphans" (season 5, episode 9)
6.  "Dinner at Eight-ish" (season 5, episode 20)
7.  "Simon Says" (season 5, episode 21)
8.  "An Old Fashioned Wedding", parts one and two (season 10, episodes 25)

On May 5, 2015, CBS DVD released _Cheers- The Complete Series_ on DVD in Region 1.[81]

Digital media distribution

The complete eleven seasons of _Cheers_ are available through the United States Netflix streaming service, the ITunes Store, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu. In Canada all seasons of Cheers are available on streaming service Crave TV.[82]


Licensing

The series lent itself naturally to the development of _Cheers_ bar-related merchandise, culminating in the development of a chain of _Cheers_ themed pubs. Paramount's licensing group, led by Tom McGrath, developed the _Cheers_ pub concept initially in partnership with Host Marriott, which placed _Cheers_ themed pubs in over 15 airports around the world.[83] Boston boasts the original _Cheers_ bar, historically known to Boston insiders as the Bull and Finch, as well as a Cheers restaurant in the Faneuil Hall marketplace, and _Sam's Place_, a spin-off sports bar concept also located at Faneuil Hall. In 1997 Europe's first officially licensed _Cheers_ bar opened in London's Regent's Street W1. Like Cheers Faneuil Hall, Cheers London is a replica of the set. The gala opening was attended by James Burrows and cast members George Wendt and John Ratzenberger.[84] The _Cheers_ bar in London closed on 31st Dec 2008. The actual bar set had been on display at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum until the museum's closing in early 2006.[85]

The theme song to the show was eventually licensed to a Canadian restaurant, Kelsey's Neighbourhood Bar & Grill.[86]

CBS currently holds the rights to the _Cheers_ franchise as the result of the 2006 Viacom split which saw Paramount transfer its entire television studio to CBS.


Spin-offs, crossovers, and cultural references

Some of the actors and actresses from _Cheers_ brought their characters into other television shows, either in a guest appearance or in a new spin-off series. The most successful _Cheers_ spin-off was _Frasier_, which featured Frasier Crane following his relocation back to Seattle, Washington. Sam, Diane, and Woody all individually appeared in _Frasier_ episodes, with Lilith appearing as a guest on multiple episodes. In the season nine episode "Cheerful Goodbyes", Frasier returns to Boston and meets up with the Cheers gang, later attending Cliff's retirement party.

Although _Frasier_ was more successful, _The Tortellis_ was the first series to spin-off from _Cheers_, premiering in 1987. The show featured Carla's ex-husband Nick Tortelli and his wife Loretta, but was canceled after 13 episodes and drew protests for its stereotypical depictions of Italian-Americans.

In addition to direct spin-offs, several _Cheers_ characters had guest appearance crossovers with other shows, including _Wings_ and _St. Elsewhere_ (episode "Cheers"). _Cheers_ has also been spoofed or referenced in other media, including _The Simpsons_ (spoofing the title sequence and theme song in "Flaming Moe's"; actually visiting the place with vocal role reprises of the majority of the principal cast in "Fear of Flying"), _Scrubs_ (episode "My Life in Four Cameras"), _Adventure Time_ (episode "Simon & Marcy"), the 2012 comedy film _Ted_, and the 2011 video game _Dragon Age II_. In one episode of ‘’Becker’’, Becker (Ted Danson), stops in at a bar preferring to have a few drinks and get home in time to watch the Knicks game instead of attending his ex wife's wedding in Connecticut. George Wendt is the bar tender. In the season 4 episode of _Seinfeld_ entitled "The Pitch", Jerry and George are presenting their idea for a sitcom to NBC executives. George is unhappy with their offer and feels that he deserves the same salary as Ted Danson which he claims was $800,000 per episode, being that _Cheers_ is also an NBC show. Danson's reported salary was actually $250,000 per episode. At this point Cheers was in its 10th season and Ted Danson had won an Emmy and a Golden Globe the year before.

In the 2015 video game _Fallout 4_, set in Boston, there is a bar named 'Prost Bar' near Boston Common which, when entered, is an almost exact replica of the bar used in the series. It includes two dead bodies sat at the end of the bar, with one of them wearing a mail carrier's uniform, a direct reference to regular barfly Cliff Clavin.[87]

The eighth anniversary special of _Late Night with David Letterman_, airing in 1990, began with a scene at Cheers, in which the bar's TV gets stuck on NBC, and all of the bar patrons decide to go home instead of staying to watch Letterman. The scene was re-used to open Letterman's final episode in 1993. A similar scene aired in the Super Bowl XVII Pregame Show on NBC, in which the characters briefly discuss the upcoming game.

In the second-season episode "Swarley" of the sitcom _How I Met Your Mother_, in the final scene, Barney walks into the bar and everyone shouts "Swarley," same as when the characters traditionally yelled "Norm!" whenever Norm Peterson entered the Cheers bar, and he turns and walks out dejectedly as Carl the bartender plays "Where Everybody Knows Your Name." The camera angle also changes to show the same bar set-up and framing for the main interior bar shots featured in _Cheers_. Additionally, the end credits are done in the gold "Cooper Black" font of the _Cheers_ credits (which was a highly popular font for sitcoms of the early-to-mid-1980s).

The _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ character Morn is named for Norm Peterson due to Armin Shimerman calling the originally nameless character "Norm" between takes.

The theatrical play _Cheers: Live On Stage_ reenacts a condensed version of the first two seasons of the show.[88]

One episode of _Cheers_ has a crossover reference to _Spenser: For Hire_ (a Cheers bartender has a cameo appearance as an unspeaking extra).

In _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_, Peter Quill makes numerous references to the show _Cheers._

In the season 2 finale of the NBC sitcom _The Good Place_, Ted Danson's character Michael appears as a bartender while wearing a blue plaid button-down, in a clear homage to Danson's character in _Cheers_.[89]

In _A Night at the Roxbury_, Dan Hedaya's character Kamehl Butabi and his friends are listening to Emily (Molly Shannon) play the piano. She was playing the song "Where Everybody Knows Your Name" which is clearly a reference to Hedaya's past as Nick Tortelli on _Cheers_.


Remake

In September 2011, Plural Entertainment debuted a remake of the series on Spanish television, also titled _Cheers_. Set at an Irish pub, it starred Alberto San Juan as Nicolás "Nico" Arnedo, the equivalent of Sam Malone in the original series. It also used the original theme song, rerecorded in Spanish by Dani Martín, under the title of "Dónde la gente se divierte."

In December 2012, The Irish Film and Television Network announced that casting was underway on an Irish language version of _Cheers_ produced by production company Sideline. The new show, tentatively titled _Teach Seán_, would air on Ireland's TG4 and features a main character who, like Sam Malone, is a bar owner, a retired athlete and a recovering alcoholic. Except because of the setting in Ireland, the barman is a "former hurling star" rather than an ex-baseball player.[90]


_Cheers: Live On Stage_

On September 9, 2016, a stage adaptation called, _Cheers: Live On Stage_, opened at the Schubert Theatre in Boston. Comprising pieces of the original TV series, the play was adapted by Erik Forrest Jackson. It is produced by Troika/Stageworks. The director was Matt Lenz. It starred Grayson Powell as "Sam Malone," Jillian Louis as "Diane Chambers," Barry Pearl as "Ernie 'Coach' Pantusso," Sarah Sirotta as "Carla Tortelli," Paul Vogt as "Norm Peterson", and Buzz Roddy as "Cliff Clavin." The production was scheduled to tour through 2017.[91][92]
