A NON-BLANCHING RASH (NBR) is a skin rash that does not fade when pressed with, and viewed through, a glass.

It is a characteristic of both purpuric and petechial rashes.[1] Individual purpura measure 3–10 mm (0.3–1 cm, - in), whereas petechiae measure less than 3 mm.[2]

A non-blanching rash can be a symptom of bacterial meningitis,[3] but this is not the exclusive cause.[4][5]
