King Carol I of Romania points his pistol at King Peter I of Serbia and King Constantine of Greece while he steals Southern Dobrudja from the disarmed Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria. The title "KLEPTOROUMANIA" is a pun on kleptomania, the mental disorder of impulsive stealing for the sake of stealing (using a then-familiar anglicization of Romania's name).]]

The PUN, also called PARONOMASIA, is a form of word play that exploits multiple meanings of a term, or of similar-sounding words, for an intended humorous or rhetorical effect. These ambiguities can arise from the intentional use of homophonic, homographic, metonymic, or figurative language. A pun differs from a malapropism in that a malapropism is an incorrect variation on a correct expression, while a pun involves expressions with multiple (correct or fairly reasonable) interpretations. Puns may be regarded as in-jokes or idiomatic constructions, especially as their usage and meaning are usually specific to a particular language or its culture.

Puns have a long history in human writing. For example, the Roman playwright Plautus was famous for his puns and word games.[1][2]


Typology

Puns can be classified in various ways.

Homophonic

The homophonic pun, a common type, uses word pairs which sound alike (homophones) but are not synonymous.[3] Walter Redfern summarized this type with his statement, "To pun is to treat homonyms as synonyms."[4] For example, in George Carlin's phrase "atheism is a non-prophet institution", the word _prophet_ is put in place of its homophone _profit_, altering the common phrase "non-profit institution". Similarly, the joke "Question: Why do we still have troops in Germany? Answer: To keep the Russians in Czech" relies on the aural ambiguity of the homophones _check_ and _Czech_. Often, puns are not strictly homophonic, but play on words of similar, not identical, sound as in the example from the _Pinky and the Brain_ cartoon film series: "I think so, Brain, but if we give peas a chance, won't the lima beans feel left out?" which plays with the similar—but not identical—sound of _peas_ and _peace_ in the anti-war slogan "Give Peace a Chance".[5]

Homographic

A _homographic_ pun exploits words which are spelled the same (homographs) but possess different meanings and sounds. Because of their nature, they rely on sight more than hearing, contrary to homophonic puns. They are also known as _heteronymic puns_. Examples in which the punned words typically exist in two different parts of speech often rely on unusual sentence construction, as in the anecdote: "When asked to explain his large number of children, the pig answered simply: 'The wild oats of my sow gave us many piglets.'" An example that combines homophonic and homographic punning is Douglas Adams's line "You can tune a guitar, but you can't tuna fish. Unless of course, you play bass." The phrase uses the homophonic qualities of _tune a_ and _tuna_, as well as the homographic pun on _bass_, in which ambiguity is reached through the identical spellings of (a string instrument), and (a kind of fish). Homographic puns do not necessarily need to follow grammatical rules and often do not make sense when interpreted outside the context of the pun.

_Homonymic_ puns, another common type, arise from the exploitation of words which are both homographs and homophones. The statement "Being in politics is just like playing golf: you are trapped in one bad lie after another" puns on the two meanings of the word _lie_ as "a deliberate untruth" and as "the position in which something rests". An adaptation of a joke repeated by Isaac Asimov gives us "Did you hear about the little moron who strained himself while running into the screen door?" playing on _strained_ as "to give much effort" and "to filter".[6] A homonymic pun may also be polysemic, in which the words must be homonymic and also possess related meanings, a condition that is often subjective. However, lexicographers define polysemes as listed under a single dictionary lemma (a unique numbered meaning) while homonyms are treated in separate lemmata.

Compounded

A compound pun is a statement that contains two or more puns. In this case, the wordplay cannot go into effect by utilizing the separate words or phrases of the puns that make up the entire statement. For example, a complex statement by Richard Whately includes four puns: "Why can a man never starve in the Great Desert? Because he can eat the sand which is there. But what brought the sandwiches there? Why, Noah sent Ham, and his descendants mustered and bred."[7] This pun uses _sand which is there/sandwiches there_, _Ham/ham_, _mustered/mustard_, and _bred/bread_. Similarly, the phrase "piano is not my forte" links two meanings of the words _forte_ and _piano_, one for the dynamic markings in music and the second for the literal meaning of the sentence, as well as alluding to "pianoforte", the older name of the instrument. Compound puns may also combine two phrases that share a word. For example, "Where do mathematicians go on weekends? To a Möbius strip club!" puns on the terms _Möbius strip_ and _strip club_.

Recursive

A recursive pun is one in which the second aspect of a pun relies on the understanding of an element in the first. For example, the statement "π is only half a pie." (π radians is 180 degrees, or half a circle, and a pie is a complete circle). Another example is "Infinity is not in finity", which means infinity is not in finite range. Another example is "a Freudian slip is when you say one thing but mean your mother."[8] The recursive pun "Immanuel doesn't pun, he Kant," is attributed to Oscar Wilde.[9]

Visual

148FS_USAF_emblem.png emblem, a visual pun.]] Visual puns are sometimes used in logos, emblems, insignia, and other graphic symbols, in which one or more of the pun aspects is replaced by a picture. In European heraldry, this technique is called canting arms. Visual and other puns and word games are also common in Dutch gable stones as well as in some cartoons, such as _Lost Consonants_ and _The Far Side_. Another type of visual pun exists in languages which use non-phonetic writing. For example, in Chinese, a pun may be based on a similarity in shape of the written character, despite a complete lack of phonetic similarity in the words punned upon.[10] Mark Elvin describes how this "peculiarly Chinese form of visual punning involved comparing written characters to objects."[11]

Other

Richard J. Alexander notes two additional forms which puns may take: graphological (sometimes called visual) puns, such as concrete poetry; and morphological puns, such as portmanteaux.[12]


Use

Comedy and jokes

Puns are a common source of humour in jokes and comedy shows. They are often used in the punch line of a joke, where they typically give a humorous meaning to a rather perplexing story. These are also known as feghoots. The following example comes from the movie _Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World_, though the punchline stems from far older Vaudeville roots.[13] The final line puns on the stock phrase "the lesser of two evils".



        Captain Aubrey, played by Russell Crowe: "Do you see those two weevils, Doctor?...Which would you choose?"
        Dr. Maturin: "Neither. There's not a scrap of difference between them. They're the same species of _Curculio_."
        Captain Aubrey: "If you had to choose. If you were forced to make a choice. If there were no other option."
        Dr. Maturin: "Well, then, if you're going to push me. I would choose the right-hand weevil. It has significant advantage in both length and breadth."
        Captain Aubrey: "There, I have you!...Do you not know that in the Service, one must always choose _the lesser of two weevils_?"

In a similar vein, there was the artist, shopping for supplies, who purchased the lesser of the two easels.

Puns often are used in the titles of comedic parodies. A parody of a popular song, movie, etc., may be given a title that hints at the title of the work being parodied, replacing some of the words with ones that sound or look similar. For example, collegiate a cappella groups are often named after musical puns to attract fans through attempts at humor. Such a title can immediately communicate both that what follows is a parody and also which work is about to be parodied, making any further "setup" (introductory explanation) unnecessary.

2014 saw the inaugural UK Pun Championships, at the Leicester Comedy Festival, hosted by Lee Nelson. The winner was Darren Walsh. The competition included the line "My computer's got a Miley Virus. It's stopped twerking."[14] Walsh went on to take part in the O. Henry Pun-Off World Championships in Austin, Texas.[15] In 2015 the UK Pun Champion was Leo Kearse.[16]

Books never written

Sometimes called "books never written" or "world's greatest books", these are jokes which consist of fictitious book titles with authors' names that contain a pun relating to the title.[17] Perhaps the best-known example is: "_Tragedy on the Cliff_ by Eileen Dover", which according to one source was devised by humourist Peter DeVries.[18] It is common for these puns to refer to taboo subject matter, such as "_What Boys Love_ by E. Norma Stitts".[19]

Literature

Non-humorous puns were and are a standard poetic device in English literature. Puns and other forms of wordplay have been used by many famous writers, such as Alexander Pope,[20] James Joyce,[21] Vladimir Nabokov,[22] Robert Bloch,[23] Lewis Carroll,[24] John Donne,[25] and William Shakespeare, who is estimated to have used over 3,000 puns in his plays.[26]

Here is an example from Shakespeare's _Richard III_:



        "Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this _son_ of York" (_Son_/_sun_)

Shakespeare was also noted for his frequent play with less serious puns, the "quibbles" of the sort that made Samuel Johnson complain, "A quibble is to Shakespeare what luminous vapours are to the traveller! He follows it to all adventures; it is sure to lead him out of his way, sure to engulf him in the mire. It has some malignant power over his mind, and its fascinations are irresistible."[27] Elsewhere, Johnson disparagingly referred to punning as the lowest form of humour.[28]

In the poem _A Hymn to God the Father_, John Donne, married to Anne More, reportedly puns repeatedly: "Son/sun" in the second quoted line, and two compound puns on "Donne/done" and "More/more". All three are homophonic, with the puns on "more" being both homographic and CAPITONYMIC. The ambiguities serve to introduce several possible meanings into the verses.



        "When Thou hast _done_, Thou hast not _done_ / For I have _more_.
        that at my death Thy _Son_ / Shall shine as he shines now, and heretofore
        And having _done_ that, Thou hast _done_; / I fear no _more_."

Alfred Hitchcock stated, "Puns are the highest form of literature."[29]

Rhetoric

Puns can function as a rhetorical device, where the pun serves as a persuasive instrument for an author or speaker. Although puns are sometimes perceived as trite or silly, if used responsibly a pun "…can be an effective communication tool in a variety of situations and forms".[30] A major difficulty in using puns in this manner is that the meaning of a pun can be interpreted very differently according to the audience's background and can significantly subtract from a message.[31]

Design

Like other forms of wordplay, paronomasia is occasionally used for its attention-getting or mnemonic qualities, making it common in titles and the names of places, characters, and organizations, and in advertising and slogans.[32][33]

Many restaurant and shop names use puns: Cane & Able mobility healthcare, Sam & Ella's Chicken Palace, Tiecoon tie shop, Planet of the Grapes wine and spirits,[34] Curl Up and Dye hair salon, as do books such as _Pies and Prejudice_, comics (_YU+ME: dream_) and films (_Good Will Hunting_). The Japanese anime _Speed Racer's_ original title, _Mach GoGoGo!_ refers to the English word itself, the Japanese word for five (the Mach 5's car number), and the name of the show's main character, Go Mifune. This is also an example of a multilingual pun, full understanding of which requires knowledge of more than one language on the part of the listener.

Names of fictional characters also often carry puns, such as Ash Ketchum and Goku ("Kakarrot"), the protagonists of the anime series based on the video game series _Pokémon_ and the manga series _Dragon Ball_, respectively, both franchises which are known for including second meanings in the names of many of their characters. A recurring motif in the _Austin Powers_ films repeatedly puns on names which suggest male genitalia. In the science fiction television series _Star Trek_, "B-4" is used as the name of one of four androids models constructed "before" the android Data, a main character. And a librarian in another Star Trek episode was named 'Mr. Atoz' (A to Z).

The parallel sequel _The Lion King 1½_ advertised with the phrase "You haven't seen the 1/2 of it!". Wyborowa Vodka employed the slogan "Enjoyed for centuries straight", while Northern Telecom used "Technology the world calls on."[35]

On 1 June 2015 the BBC Radio 4 _You and Yours_ included a feature on "Puntastic Shop Titles". Entries included a Chinese Takeaway in Ayr town centre called "Ayr’s Wok", a kebab shop in Ireland called "Abra Kebabra" and a tree-surgeon in Dudley called ‘’Special Branch." The winning competition entry, selected by Lee Nelson, was a dry cleaner's in Fulham and Chelsea called "Starchy and Starchy".[36]


In the media

Paronomasia has found a strong foothold in the media. William Safire of the _New York Times_ suggests that "the root of this pace-growing [use of paranomasia] is often a headline-writer’s need for quick catchiness, and has resulted in a new tolerance for a long-despised form of humor."[37] It can be argued that paronomasia is common in the media, especially headlines, to draw the reader's interest. The rhetoric is important because it connects people with the topic. A notable example is the New York Post headline "Headless Body in Topless Bar." [38]

Paronomasia is prevalent orally as well. Salvatore Attardo believes that puns are verbal humor. He talks about Pepicello and Weisberg's linguistic theory of humor and believes the only form of linguistic humor is limited to puns.[39] This is because a pun is a play on the word itself. Attardo believes that only puns are able to maintain humor and this humor has significance. It is able to help soften a situation and make it less serious, it can help make something more memorable, and using a pun can make the speaker seem witty.

Paronomasia is strong in print media and oral conversation so it can be assumed that paronomasia is strong in broadcast media as well. Examples of paranomasia in media are sound bites. They could be memorable because of the humor and rhetoric associated with paronomasia, thus making the significance of the sound bite stronger.


Confusion and alternative uses

There exist subtle differences between paronomasia and other literary techniques, such as the double entendre. While puns are often simple wordplay for comedic or rhetorical effect, a double entendre alludes to a second meaning which is not contained within the statement or phrase itself, often one which purposefully disguises the second meaning. As both exploit the use of intentional double meanings, puns can sometimes be double entendres, and vice versa. Puns also bear similarities with paraprosdokian, syllepsis, and eggcorns. In addition, homographic puns are sometimes compared to the stylistic device antanaclasis, and homophonic puns to polyptoton. Puns can be used as a type of mnemonic device to enhance comprehension in an educational setting. Used discreetly, puns can effectively reinforce content and aid in the retention of material. Some linguists have encouraged the creation of neologisms to decrease the instances of confusion caused by puns.[40]


History

Puns were found in ancient Egypt, where they were heavily used in the development of myths and interpretation of dreams.[41]

In China, Shen Dao (ca. 300 BC) used "shi", meaning "power", and "shi", meaning "position" to say that a king has power because of his position as king.[42]

In ancient Mesopotamia, about 2500 BC, punning was used by scribes to represent words in cuneiform.[43]

The Hebrew Bible contains puns.[44]

The Maya are known for having used puns in their hieroglyphic writing, and for using them in their modern languages.[45]

In Japan, "graphomania" was one type of pun.[46]

In Tamil, "Sledai" is the word used to mean pun in which a word with two different meanings. This is also classified as a poetry style in ancient Tamil literature. Similarly, in Telugu language, "Slesha" is the equivalent word and is among one of the several poetry styles in Telugu literature.
