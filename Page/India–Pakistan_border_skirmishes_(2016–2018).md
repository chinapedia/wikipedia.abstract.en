On 29 September 2016, BORDER SKIRMISHES BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN began following reported "surgical strikes" by India against militant launch pads across the Line of Control in Pakistani-administered Azad Kashmir.[1]

Pakistan rejected that a strike took place,[2] stating that Indian troops had not crossed the Line of Control but had only skirmished with Pakistani troops at the border, resulting in the deaths of two Pakistani soldiers and the wounding of nine.[3][4] Pakistan rejected India's reports of any other casualties.[5] Pakistani sources reported that at least 8 Indian soldiers were killed in the exchange, and one was captured.[6][7] India confirmed that one of its soldiers was in Pakistani custody, but denied that it was linked to the incident or that any of its soldiers had been killed.[8]

The Indian operation was said to be in retaliation for a militant attack on the Indian army at Uri on 18 September in the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir that left 19 soldiers dead.[9][10] In the succeeding days and months, India and Pakistan continued to exchange fire along the border in Kashmir, resulting in dozens of military and civilian casualties on both sides.

2016 – Surgical strikes

On 29 September, eleven days after the Uri attack, the Indian army reported it conducted surgical strikes against suspected militants in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. Lt Gen Ranbir Singh, Indian Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), said that it had received "very credible and specific information" about "terrorist teams" who were preparing to "carry out infiltration and conduct terrorist strikes inside Jammu and Kashmir and in various metros in other states". The Indian action was meant to pre-empt their infiltration.[11][12] Indian media reported variously that between 35 and 70 terrorists had been killed.[13][14][15]

Pakistan denied that such surgical strikes occurred. The Inter-Services Public Relations said that there had been only "cross border firing".[16] But, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the "unprovoked and naked aggression of Indian forces", which he said resulted in the death of two Pakistani soldiers.[17][18]

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said that the UN Observer Group in Pakistani Kashmir did not directly observe any "firing across the Line of Control" relating to the incident.[19][20] The Indian envoy at UN Syed Akbaruddin dismissed this statement, saying "facts on the ground do not change whether somebody acknowledges or not."[21]

Analyst Sandeep Singh, writing in _The Diplomat,_ said that the operation is better characterised as a cross-border raid because "surgical strikes" involve striking deep into the enemy territory and typically using air power.

Aftermath

Subsequently, the ceasefire along the Line of Control largely held, despite sporadic violations, leading to cautious optimism among Indian officials that it would continue.[237]

Between early August and early September, Pakistan reported four civilians were killed in Indian cross-border shelling.[238][239] In addition, India reported two civilian deaths due to Pakistani fire by the start of October[240][241] and claimed that in retaliation its Army had killed two Pakistani soldiers.[242][243] Despite this, during military talks between India and Pakistan that were held in mid-August, Pakistan expressed satisfaction on the measures being taken along the Line of Control by troops to maintain the ceasefire.[244] Firing continued for the next months, after the end of ceasefire.[245] From November to December, 7 Indian army soldiers were killed by Pakistani sniper fire from across the border.[246][247][248] Indian media reported that there were 2,936 instances of ceasefire violations by Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir in 2018.[249]
