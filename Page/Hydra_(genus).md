_HYDRA_ is a genus of small, fresh-water organisms of the phylum Cnidaria and class Hydrozoa. They are native to the temperate and tropical regions.[1][2] Biologists are especially interested in _Hydra_ because of their regenerative ability — they do not appear to die of old age, or indeed to age at all.


Morphology

_Hydra_ has a tubular, radially symmetric body up to long when extended, secured by a simple adhesive foot called the basal disc. Gland cells in the basal disc secrete a sticky fluid that accounts for its adhesive properties.

At the free end of the body is a mouth opening surrounded by one to twelve thin, mobile tentacles. Each tentacle, or cnida (plural: cnidae), is clothed with highly specialised stinging cells called cnidocytes. Cnidocytes contain specialized structures called nematocysts, which look like miniature light bulbs with a coiled thread inside. At the narrow outer edge of the cnidocyte is a short trigger hair called a cnidocil. Upon contact with prey, the contents of the nematocyst are explosively discharged, firing a dart-like thread containing neurotoxins into whatever triggered the release. This can paralyze the prey, especially if many hundreds of nematocysts are fired.

_Hydra_ has two main body layers, which makes it "diploblastic". The layers are separated by mesoglea, a gel-like substance. The outer layer is the epidermis, and the inner layer is called the gastrodermis, because it lines the stomach. The cells making up these two body layers are relatively simple. Hydramacin[3] is a bactericide recently discovered in _Hydra_; it protects the outer layer against infection. A single _Hydra_ is composed of 50,000 to 100,000 cells which consist of three specific stem cell populations that will create many different cell types. These stem cells will continually renew themselves in the body column_._[4] _Hydras_ have two significant structures on their body: the "head" and the "foot". When a _Hydra_ is cut in half, each half will regenerate and form into a small _Hydra_; the "head" will regenerate a "foot" and the "foot" will regenerate a "head". If the _Hydra_ is sliced into many segments then the middle slices will form both a "head" and a "foot".[5]

Respiration and excretion occur by diffusion throughout the surface of the epidermis, while larger excreta are discharged through the mouth.


Nervous system

The nervous system of _Hydra_ is a nerve net, which is structurally simple compared to more derived animal nervous systems. _Hydra_ does not have a recognizable brain or true muscles. Nerve nets connect sensory photoreceptors and touch-sensitive nerve cells located in the body wall and tentacles.

The structure of the nerve net has two levels:

-   level 1- sensory cells or internal cells;
-   level 2- interconnected ganglion cells synapsed to epithelial or motor cells.

Some has only two sheets of neurons.[6]


Motion and locomotion

If _Hydra_ are alarmed or attacked, the tentacles can be retracted to small buds, and the body column itself can be retracted to a small gelatinous sphere. _Hydra_ generally react in the same way regardless of the direction of the stimulus, and this may be due to the simplicity of the nerve nets.

_Hydra_ are generally sedentary or sessile, but do occasionally move quite readily, especially when hunting. They have two distinct methods for moving – 'looping' and 'somersaulting'. They do this by bending over and attaching themselves to the substrate with the mouth and tentacles and then relocate the foot, which provides the usual attachment, this process is called looping. In somersaulting, the body then bends over and makes a new place of attachment with the foot. By this process of "looping" or "somersaulting", a _Hydra_ can move several inches (c. 100 mm) in a day. _Hydra_ may also move by amoeboid motion of their bases or by detaching from the substrate and floating away in the current.


Reproduction and life cycle

2. Creating a bud
3. Daughter growing out
4. Beginning to cleave
5. Daughter broken off
6. Daughter clone of parent]] When food is plentiful, many _Hydra_ reproduce asexually by producing buds in the body wall, which grow to be miniature adults and break away when they are mature.

When a hydra is well fed, a new bud can form every two days.[7] When conditions are harsh, often before winter or in poor feeding conditions, sexual reproduction occurs in some _Hydra_. Swellings in the body wall develop into either ovaries or testes. The testes release free-swimming gametes into the water, and these can fertilize the egg in the ovary of another individual. The fertilized eggs secrete a tough outer coating, and, as the adult dies (due to starvation and/or cold), these resting eggs fall to the bottom of the lake or pond to await better conditions, whereupon they hatch into nymph _Hydra_. Some _Hydra_ species, like _Hydra circumcincta_ and _Hydra viridissima_, are hermaphrodites[8] and may produce both testes and ovaries at the same time.

Many members of the Hydrozoa go through a body change from a polyp to an adult form called a medusa, which is usually the life stage where sexual reproduction occurs, but _Hydra_ do not progress beyond the polyp phase.


Feeding

_Hydra_ mainly feed on aquatic invertebrates such as _Daphnia_ and _Cyclops_.

While feeding, _Hydra_ extend their body to maximum length and then slowly extend their tentacles. Despite their simple construction, the tentacles of _Hydra_ are extraordinarily extensible and can be four to five times the length of the body. Once fully extended, the tentacles are slowly manoeuvred around waiting for contact with a suitable prey animal. Upon contact, nematocysts on the tentacle fire into the prey, and the tentacle itself coils around the prey. Within 30 seconds, most of the remaining tentacles will have already joined in the attack to subdue the struggling prey. Within two minutes, the tentacles will have surrounded the prey and moved it into the opened mouth aperture. Within ten minutes, the prey will have been engulfed within the body cavity, and digestion will have started. _Hydra_ are able to stretch their body wall considerably in order to digest prey more than twice their size. After two or three days, the indigestible remains of the prey will be discharged through the mouth aperture via contractions.

The feeding behaviour of _Hydra_ demonstrates the sophistication of what appears to be a simple nervous system.

Some species of _Hydra_ exist in a mutual relationship with various types of unicellular algae. The algae are protected from predators by _Hydra_ and, in return, photosynthetic products from the algae are beneficial as a food source to _Hydra_.


Measuring the feeding response

The feeding response in _Hydra_ is induced by reduced glutathione released from injured prey.[9] There are several methods conventionally used for quantification of the feeding response. In some, the duration for which the mouth remains open is measured.[10] Other methods rely on counting the number of _Hydra_ among a small population showing the feeding response after addition of glutathione.[11] Recently, an assay for measuring the feeding response in hydra has been developed.[12] In this method, the linear two-dimensional distance between the tip of the tentacle and the mouth of hydra was shown to be a direct measure of the extent of the feeding response. This method has been validated using a starvation model, as starvation is known to cause enhancement of the _Hydra_ feeding response.[13]


Morphallaxis

_Hydra_ undergoes morphallaxis (tissue regeneration) when injured or severed. Typically, _Hydras_ will reproduce by just budding off a whole new individual, the bud will occur around two-thirds of the way down the body axis. When a _Hydra_ is cut in half, each half will regenerate and form into a small _Hydra_; the "head" will regenerate a "foot" and the "foot" will regenerate a "head". This regeneration occurs without cell division. If the _Hydra_ is sliced into many segments then the middle slices will form both a "head" and a "foot".[14] The polarity of the regeneration is explained by two pairs of positional value gradients. There is both a head and foot activation and inhibition gradient. The head activation and inhibition works in an opposite direction of the pair of foot gradients.[15] The evidence for these gradients was shown in the early 1900s with grafting experiments. The inhibitors for both gradients have shown to be important to block the bud formation. The location that the bud will form is where the gradients are low for both the head and foot.[16] _Hydras_ are capable of regenerating from pieces of tissue from the body and additionally after tissue dissociation from reaggregates.[17]


Non-senescence

Daniel Martinez claimed in a 1998 article in _Experimental Gerontology_ that _Hydra_ are biologically immortal.[18] This publication has been widely cited as evidence that _Hydra_ do not senesce (do not age), and that they are proof of the existence of non-senescing organisms generally. In 2010, Preston Estep published (also in _Experimental Gerontology_) a letter to the editor arguing that the Martinez data _refute_ the hypothesis that _Hydra_ do not senesce.[19]

The controversial unlimited life span of _Hydra_ has attracted much attention from scientists. Research today appears to confirm Martinez' study.[20] _Hydra_ stem cells have a capacity for indefinite self-renewal. The transcription factor "forkhead box O" (FoxO) has been identified as a critical driver of the continuous self-renewal of _Hydra_.[21] In experiments, a drastically reduced population growth resulted from FoxO down-regulation.[22]

In bilaterally symmetrical organisms (Bilateria), the transcription factor FoxO impacts stress response, lifespan, and increase in stem cells. If this transcription factor is knocked down in bilaterian model organisms, such as fruit flies and nematodes, their lifespan is significantly decreased. In experiments on _H. vulgaris_ (a radially symmetrical member of phylum Cnidaria), when FoxO levels were decreased, there was a negative impact of many key features of the _Hydra_, but no death was observed, thus it is believed other factors may contribute to the apparent lack of aging in these creatures.[23]

While _Hydra_ immortality is well-supported today, the implications for human aging are still controversial. There is much optimism;[24] however, it appears that researchers still have a long way to go before they are able to understand how the results of their work might apply to the reduction or elimination of human senescence.[25]


Genomics

An orthologome analysis done within the last decade demonstrated that _Hydra_ share a minimum of 6071 genes with humans. _Hydra_ is becoming an increasingly better model system as more genetic approaches become available.[26] A draft of the genome of _Hydra magnipapillata_ was reported in 2010.[27]
