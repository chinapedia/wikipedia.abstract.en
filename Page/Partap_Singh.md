GIANI PARTAP SINGH (Punjabi: ਗਿਆਨੀ ਪ੍ਰਤਾਪ ਸਿੰਘ; 3 January 1904 – 10 May 1984) was a Sikh priest and Panjabi writer. He served as the first acting Jathedar of Akal Takht from 19 December 1937 to 1948 and 19th Jathedar of Akal Takht from 1952 to 15 February 1955.[1]


Early life and career

Partap Singh was born on 3 January 1904, at Nara village in Rawalpindi division of Panjab, British India. His father was Makhan Singh and mother Mathura Devi. His grandfather, Sundar Singh served in the army of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Between 1909 and 1918, Singh completed 5 years of education at the local primary school in Nara and further education at the middle school in Bishan Daur. Near the completion of his primary education, he took the vows of the Khalsa and became an initiated Sikh. Subsequently, for some 3 years he studied Sikh literature and attended the services of Singh Sabha Movement and Isher Singh Rara Sahib.[2]

In 1922, Singh enrolled into Khalsa Updesh College at Gujranwala, where he passed the certificate of Giani with the second highest marks in Panjab. From 1918 to 1921, he attended various conferences organised by Chief Khalsa Diwan, Na-Milvartan Lehir and Sikh League. These conferences had a great impact on his mind and conscience.[3]

In 1923, Singh contributed with immense participation in the Kar Seva (literally "service with hands") of Harmandir Sahib. Considering the service and education of the Giani, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) employed him as a priest. Soon after he joined, the East India Company declared that the SGPC was against the law. The government arrested various SGPC workers including Singh and imprisoned them at Jhang and Multan. During the one and half years of imprisonment, the Giani managed to learn multiple languages such as English, Urdu, Persian and Hindi.[4]
