ROBERT MILLER YOUNG (1886â€“1970) was a Scottish amateur football full back who played in the Scottish League for Queen's Park.[1] He captained the club and after his retirement as a player was a member of the committee and acted as Honorary Treasurer.[2] Young also played for Motherwell and Clyde.[3]


Personal life

Prior to the First World War, Young worked as an iron merchant's clerk.[4] After Britain's entry into the war in August 1914, he enlisted as a lieutenant in the Highland Light Infantry and was commissioned in late 1915.[5] He was shot in the knee in 1917,[6] but the injury did not prevent him from returning to football before the end of the year.[7] Young moved to Manchester in 1929.[8]
