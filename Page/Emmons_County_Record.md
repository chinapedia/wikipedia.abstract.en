The _EMMONS COUNTY RECORD_ is a weekly newspaper based in Linton, North Dakota.[1]

It has been published continuously since the late 1800s, originally by D.R. Streeter.[2] In the late 1980s, while under the ownership of Cecil D. Jahraus, who was also the paper's editor and publisher, the _Emmons County Record_ became the largest weekly newspaper in the state of North Dakota by circulation. Read by over 4,000 families weekly, the newspaper had a circulation permeating all 50 U.S. states and three foreign countries. Its present owner is the Burke family.
