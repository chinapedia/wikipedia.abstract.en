_VOEZ_ (stylized as _VOEZ_) is a rhythm game developed by Rayark Inc., initially released in May 2016 for iOS devices,[1] while an Android version of the game was released one week later in June 2016.[2] In February 2017, it was announced that the game would be released on the Nintendo Switch by Japanese game publisher Flyhigh Works,[3] and was released in March 2017 worldwide.


Gameplay

VOEZ_Gameplay.pngIn each level, there is a black horizontal line at the bottom of the screen, as notes fall down from the top of the screen on the note line. The note line can move horizontally depending on the song and its chosen difficulty. The player must either tap, hold, slide or swipe the note depending on which note it is.[4]

Tap notes must be tapped when they reach the horizontal line to make them disappear. Hold notes are long notes that must be held on until the note ends. Swipe notes must be swiped in a specific direction to make them disappear, while slide notes require the player to hold their finger on the horizontal line and slide it to where the next white note will fall to so the note can disappear.[5]

A score is given based on the performance of how accurate each note is hit. The accuracy of each note is judged by either as 'Max Perfect', 'Perfect', 'OK' or 'Miss'. The total score will also show a letter grade: an S rating from 950,000 points or when player receives a title, an A rating from 880,000 points, a B rating from 780,000 points, and a C rating for any lower score. There is a combo counter which keeps count of how many notes have been hit without missing. Hitting all the notes can reward the player with a title of 'Full Combo', and there is further reward by hitting every note at 'Perfect' or 'Max Perfect' accuracy, rewarding the player with an 'All Perfect' title.

Each song has three difficulty levels—Easy, Hard and Special. The difficulty of a song is also given a numerical rating, with the higher the rating, the more difficult the song is. The player can also decide how fast the music notes will fall.

_VOEZ_ currently features more than 200 songs to play from a variety of genres, including as eurodance, synthpop, trance music, electronic music, pop music and more. The music comes from the East Asian indie artist and composers (Hong Kong, China, Macau, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan).

Release

_VOEZ_ was released on 26 May 2016 on the App Store for iOS devices and 2 June 2016 on Google Play for Android devices. The game is free to play and it features optional in-app purchases which allows users to purchase keys to unlock a song permanently. These keys can also be earned throughout the game by playing it. The game also features a free song rotation system which changes the song from being free to paid and vice versa at a certain date.[24] The game was released for the Nintendo Switch in Japan and Europe on 3 March 2017, and in North America on 9 March 2017. As the game was initially still reliant on touch controls, it was incompatible with the Nintendo Switch's TV mode functionality and could not be played with button controls,[25] though the update for version 1.3.1 added controller support and TV mode functionality.[26] For the Switch, the game was made full-priced, but with no in-game purchases, so every song in the game is unlocked from the start. This version also removed the requirement to play online from the iOS/Android version. On 10 April 2018, _VOEZ_ was removed from the Nintendo Switch eShop in North America, but it was later resubmitted.

The game is continually updated with new playable songs, including the Switch version, which received its first major content update in June 2017.[27] A physical retail release for Voez in Japan was released in January 2018.[28]


Reception

3 weeks after the game's debut, Rayark claimed there were more than 3 million total downloads of the app, with up to 900 thousand users playing daily.[29]

_VOEZ_ received mainly positive reviews. Smartphone game review site _TouchArcade_ gave a rating of 4.5 stars, stating "the game shines because of the way it does the core mechanics so well".[30] Gaming review site Game Zebo gave a rating of 4.5 stars, praising the visuals of the game and how it affects the player's experience, citing "they're also very clean and crisp. There's also a real feeling of energy to everything as columns move."[31]

Reviewing the Switch version, Ryan Craddock of Nintendo Life gave the game a "great" 8 out of 10, calling it "a beautiful rhythm game... that makes you want to keep going back for more." However, he did criticise the "quite repetitive" nature of the songs, while stating that the quality of the sound could be improved.[32]

Many reviews of the iOS/Android version of the game levelled criticism at the 'always-online' necessity, where the user needs to be connected to the Internet in order to play the game. Reviewers stated that requirement made it difficult to play the game while on the move.[33]

During a presentation in December 2017, Flyhigh Works confirmed that the Nintendo Switch port has been downloaded 50,000 times worldwide.[34]
