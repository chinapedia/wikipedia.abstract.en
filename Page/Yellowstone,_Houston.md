YELLOWSTONE, also known as OST/SOUTH UNION and SOUTHLAWN, is a neighborhood located on the South Side Houston. It is one of collection of neighborhoods in south central Houston inside Loop 610.[1]


History

Housing in the area began post World War II with most of its residents middle class white Americans. In the 1950s, the local community center (Palm Center) located in Yellowstone was the first shopping mall in Houston. The mall brought growth and wealth in the area. Unfortunately in the early 1970s, Yellowstone experienced an economic downfall and as a result several stores in the mall closed that led to “White flight.” Lower income African Americans were the majority that settled in this neighborhood after the flight. This shift impacted the community tremendously leaving behind vacant homes and businesses. Since the transition, the neighborhood has remained stagnant and the economy has not recovered, thus the demographic almost remains the same. In the late 1980s the Crips gang of Los Angeles, began to move into the area.[2] After gangs moved in, "crack houses" began to show up. HPD began to crack down on the drug dealers and gang bangers in the late 1990s. Today the neighborhood is still mostly African American but experiencing a fast growth in its Latino population.[3]

2016 Gang Injunction

Harris County authorities targeted Yellowstone, for a gang injunction to ban individuals allegedly associated with the Bloods, Crips and other groups who are suspected of ongoing criminal activity. A petition filed in September asked the court to prevent 92 men from entering the area – a large chunk of the 77021 ZIP code south of the Late last year, some defendants agreed not to enter certain portions of the zone and, this week, more than a dozen men were banned by "default" after not responding to the lawsuit. A hearing on the suit is scheduled in April. The effort by the Harris County District Attorney's Office and the County Attorney is designed to improve the environment for apartment complex residents, most poor and elderly, by officially prohibiting the presence of 92 people suspected of causing much of the area's crime, according to a petition and the application for permanent injunction. Certain sets and cliques were named in the lawsuit, including the Yellowstone Players, Southlawn Posse, Young Scott Block, 59 Bounty Hunters, 3rd Ward Players, Sunnyside Posse, Cuney Homes Brick Boys, Young Mob Gorillas and the Herschelwood Money Makerz. The Gang Injunciton became the county's third geographical gang injunction.[8]
