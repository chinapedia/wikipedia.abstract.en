_BOOK OF INTUITION_ is a studio album by jazz pianist Kenny Barron with bassist Kiyoshi Kitagawa and drummer Jonathan Blake.[1] The album was released on March 4, 2016 via Impulse! Records label.[2][3]


Background

The album contains 10 tracks, of which seven are Barron's original compositions written in a period of time. Two pieces, "In the Slow Lane" and "Prayer", were featured in the soundtrack for 2010 film _Another Harvest Moon_.[4][5] _Book of Intuition_ is Barron's first trio album in 20 some years—since _Wanton Spirit_ with Charlie Haden and Roy Haynes.[6] Barron has performed onstage with Kitagawa and Blake for 20 and 10 years respectively, yet he has never recorded an album with his long-time trio, until the present occasion.[7]

The album earned the trio a Grammy Award nomination for Best Jazz Instrumental Album.[8]


Reception

John Fordham of _The Guardian_ noted: "Barron has absorbed an encyclopaedia of jazz methods from a life on the road with legends such as Ella Fitzgerald and Stan Getz, and it pours out in these tracks. Magic Dance, with its glistening chords and Latin-jazz tick, sounds smooth at first but unleashes an impulsive torrent. Ballads such as In the Slow Lane display his impeccably light touch and Thelonious Monk’s Shuffle Boil isn’t Monkishly lateral but swings furiously. The jangling Lunacy is a collective bustle prodded by bassist Kiyoshi Kitagawa and drummer Johnathan Blake, while Nightfall is delicate drift through slow chords. There might be too many notes for some on this record, but it’s almost all affectingly musical just the same".[9]

Cormak Larkin of _The Irish Times_ wrote: "Barron’s latest trio, with the impeccable rhythm team of bassist Kiyoshi Kitagawa and drummer Jonathan Blake, is as assured and authoritative as you would expect, here emphasising the Latin side of the trio tradition with a deeply grooving set of originals (and a couple of Monk tunes) that sparkle like cut glass".[10]
