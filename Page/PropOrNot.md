PROPORNOT is a website that seeks to expose Russian propaganda and those groups that use material from Russian sources. It has been featured in _The Washington Post_ about Russian propaganda and the spread of fake news. PropOrNot's methods and anonymity have received criticism from publications such as _The New Yorker_, _Harper's_, _Fortune_, _The Intercept_, and _Rolling Stone_.


Operations and organization

The website is written anonymously, and purports to be the arbiter of which opinions are not acceptable and which are acceptable, by either labelling or not labelling certain expressed opinions as "propaganda"; a spokesperson for the website who spoke by phone to _The New Yorker_ was described as an American male who was "well versed in Internet culture and swore enthusiastically." The same spokesperson said that the group comprised around 40 (unnamed, and therefore unaccountable) individuals.[1]

Compiled list

PropOrNot has said there was a Russian propaganda effort involved in propagating fake news during the 2016 presidential election.[2][3] PropOrNot has said it analyzed data from Twitter and Facebook and tracked propaganda from a disinformation campaign by Russia that had a national reach of 15 million people within the United States.[4][5] PropOrNot concluded that accounts belonging to both Russia Today and Sputnik News promoted "false and misleading stories in their reports," and additionally magnified other false articles found on the Internet to support their propaganda effort.[6]

PropOrNot published a list of websites they called "bona-fide 'useful idiots'" of the Russian government based on methodology they called "a combination of manual and automated analysis, including analysis of content, timing, technical indicators, and other reporting".[7] The group's list included _Zero Hedge_, _Naked Capitalism_, the Ron Paul Institute, _Black Agenda Report_, _Truthout_, _Truthdig_, _antiwar.com_, and _CounterPunch_, although they did not provide any individual analysis to justify inclusion on the list.[8] _CounterPunch_ in response called PropOrNot a "shady little group," its findings "bogus," and their inclusion on the list a "baseless allegation." After email communications, PropOrNot agreed to remove _CounterPunch_ from the list.[9]


Criticism

Andrew Cockburn, Washington editor for _Harper's_, was sharply critical of _The Washington Post_{{'}}s decision to put the story on its front page, calling the article a "sorry piece of trash."[10] Writers in _The Intercept_, _Fortune_, and _Rolling Stone_ criticized _The Washington Post_ for including a report by an organization with no reputation for fact-checking in an article on "fake news."[11][12][13] _The Intercept_ journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ben Norton were particularly critical of the inclusion of _Naked Capitalism_ on the list of "useful idiots" for Russian propagandists.[14]

Later, in _The New Yorker_, Adrian Chen said that he had been previously contacted by the organization, but had chosen not to follow up with them. Looking more carefully into their methodology, he argued that PropOrNot's criteria for establishing propaganda were so broad that they could have included "not only Russian state-controlled media organizations, such as Russia Today, but nearly every news outlet in the world, including the _Post_ itself" on their list.[15]

Writing for _Rolling Stone_ magazine, Matt Taibbi questioned the methodology used by PropOrNot and the lack of information about who was behind the organization.[16]

In December 2016, after receiving criticism, _The Washington Post_ appended an "Editor's Note" to its article in response to the criticism of PropOrNot's list of websites.[17] The note read, "_The Post_, which did not name any of the sites, does not itself vouch for the validity of PropOrNot's findings regarding any individual media outlet, nor did the article purport to do so."[18]
