Early life

Barnaby Backwell was the second but first surviving son of Tyringham Backwell of Tyringham, Buckinghamshire, and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Francis Child, Lord Mayor of London.[3] He was the grandson of the financier Edward Backwell.


Career

Backwell was a partner in the bank of Samuel and Francis Child,[4] and said to have an income of £4,000 per annum.

In the General election of 1754 he was elected to Parliament for Bishop's Castle, a "rotten borough", where his uncle Samuel Child had been the M.P. until his death in 1753. The borough was under the control of the Walcots who owed a great deal of money to Child's bank. Backwell was classed as a Tory in Dupplin's list of 1754.[5]

He died the following October. He had married twice, firstly Margaret (d. 1745), the daughter of Samuel Clarke, a London merchant, and secondly Sarah Gibbon, with whom he had a son and 3 daughters. His daughter, Elizabeth Tyringham, married William Praed.
