Rinko, a writer living in Tokyo remains unmarried at 33. She has not been satisfied both in love and at work and often drinks with Kaori and Koyuki, her best friends since high school. One day, when the three women drink at an izakaya, making complaints against men they've dated before as usual, a mysterious handsome man with blond hair comes and tells them the reason they stay unmarried is they are just talking about "If I had done..." or "If he had been...".
