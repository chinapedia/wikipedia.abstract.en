"Flame palmettes" are different from regular palmettes in that, traditionally palmettes tended to have sharply splaying leaves. From the 4th century BCE however, the end of the leaves tend to turn in, forming what is called the "flame palmette" design.[1]


Greece

The first appearance of "flame palmettes" seem to occur with the stand-alone floral akroteria of the Parthenon (447-432 BCE),[2] and slightly later at the Temple of Athena Nike.[3] Flame palmettes were then introduced into friezes of floral motifs in replacement of the regular palmette. According to Boardman, although lotus friezes or palmette friezes were known in Mesopotamia centuries before, the unnatural combination of various botanical elements which have no relationship in the wild, such as the palmette, the lotus and sometimes rosette flowers, is a purely Greek innovation, which was then adopted on a very broad geographical scale.[4]

Asia Minor

In Asia Minor, some of the earliest designs of flaming palmettes can be found in the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and are dated to 350 BCE. They are also extensively used at the 3rd century BCE Ionic Temple of Didyma.

Greco-Bactria

The flame palmette design that was adopted in Hellenistic architecture and became very popular on a wide geographical scale, especially following the conquests of Alexander the Great. In the Greco-Bactrian city of Ai-Khanoum, founded circa 280 BCE, the antefixae display a flame palmette design, as do floral mosaics.
