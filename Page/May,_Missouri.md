MAY is an unincorporated community in northwest McDonald County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] The community is on the banks of Buffalo Creek, approximately south of the McDonald-Newton county line.[2]


History

A post office called May was established in 1884, and remained in operation until 1907.[3] Some say the community has the name of May Maynard, the daughter of a local physician, while others believe the place name is derived directly from the doctor's last name.[4][5]
