ALLOPREGNANEDIOL, or 5Α-PREGNANE-3Α,20Α-DIOL, is an endogenous metabolite of progesterone and allopregnanolone and an isomer of pregnanediol (5β-pregnan-3α,20α-diol).[1] It has been found to act like a partial agonist of an allosteric site of the GABA receptor and hence might play a biological role as a neurosteroid.[2] It has also been found to act as an agonist of the human pregnane X receptor, albeit with an EC₅₀ that is more than an order of magnitude lower than that of other endogenous pregnanes like pregnenolone, pregnanediol, allopregnanedione, and allopregnanolone.[3]
