Science and technology

-   Applications of nanotechnology
    -   While attempting to create a nanotechnology-based, catalyst-mediated series of chemical reactions to turn carbon dioxide ({{chem (a greenhouse gas) into a usable fuel, scientists at the Department of Energyâ€™s Oak Ridge National Laboratory instead discover a single-step process using the surface area of tiny spikes of copper and carbon as a catalyst to turn carbon dioxide into ethanol ({{chem. The reaction may serve as a method to alleviate possible climate change by both decreasing in the atmosphere and by using the ethanol as an additive to fuels to increase efficiency and thereby decrease consumption.
