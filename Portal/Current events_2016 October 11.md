    -   While in pursuit of a Russian Ultranationalist Vladimir Makarov, in Prague, Czech Republic, Captain John "Soap" MacTavish is thrown from a church bell tower by a suicide bomb set off by the Russian terrorist's defence team. After falling from the tower and through scaffolding, MacTavish was pronounced KIA less than ten minutes after, suffering from massive haemorrhaging and two punctured lungs. There were two dead and one injured, MacTavish's fellow Task Force 141 member, known only as Commander Yuri, who used to work for Makarov, in the explosion. This set off a chain of events leading to a helicopter crash, involving Makarov, Yuri, and Captain John Price. While all three survived the impact, Yuri was shot soon after by Makarov, and Price engaged in hand to hand combat with Makarov, where he eventually was able to overwhelm him. Makarov was killed by a cervical fracture, when his neck was wrapped in a loose hanging cord, and the glass floor underneath him collapsed. Price survived the incident, and later retired and entered Witness Protection.
