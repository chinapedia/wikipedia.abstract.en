The EUROPE WIKIPROJECT is a project committed to improving, expanding and co-ordinating Wikipedia's coverage of topics related to Europe: the continent, its people and their culture. It concentrates primarily on matters of a pan-European, or cross-border nature; including international organisations (other than the European Union, which has its own project). The project also manages the European portal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The aims of this project are:

-   To increase the number of articles related to Europe
-   To improve the quality of articles related to Europe
-   To create as many featured articles about Europe as possible

We acknowledge and are grateful for the work of the other projects working in this area. This project will also be focusing on those countries which do not actively have an existing WikiProject working with them, specifically Cyprus and North Macedonia. It shall also maintain the European portal.
