US_67_in_LeClaire_Iowa.jpg U.S. HIGHWAY 67 (US 67) is a U.S. Highway in extreme eastern Iowa. The route begins in Davenport at the Rock Island Centennial Bridge where it crosses the Mississippi River and ends at an intersection with US 52 and Iowa Highway 64 (Iowa 64) west of Sabula. It passes through Bettendorf, Le Claire, and Clinton. Except for Folletts, every community which US 67 enters sits along the Mississippi River. As such, the entire route is part of the Great River Road, an All-American Road. US 67 was created in late 1934, when it replaced US 55 from Davenport to Dubuque. The route ended then at the foot of the Julien Dubuque Bridge, which carries US 20. The northern half of the route, from Sabula to Dubuque, was overlapped by US 52 until 1967. Most of the state highways that intersect US 67 do so within sight of their Mississippi River bridge crossing.
